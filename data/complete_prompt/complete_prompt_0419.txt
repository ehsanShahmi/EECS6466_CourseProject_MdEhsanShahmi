def task_func(X, Y):
    """
    This function should:
    - Splits the input data into training (70%) and test (30%) sets.
    - Constructs a Keras Sequential model with one hidden dense layer and sigmoid activation.
      The input dimension is determined based on the first feature set of X.
    - Compiles the model using binary cross-entropy loss and SGD optimizer.
    - Fits the model to the training data in a non-verbose mode.
    - Plots the Precision-Recall curve for the model based on the test set data.

    Parameters:
    X (np.ndarray): Input data for the model. Must have at least one feature.
    Y (np.ndarray): Target labels for the model.

    Returns:
    - keras.models.Sequential: The trained Keras model.
    - matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes: The matplotlib Axes object for the Precision-Recall curve plot.
    
    Notes:
    - The plot's x-axis is labeled 'Recall', and the y-axis is labeled 'Precision'.
    - The title of the axes is set to 'Precision-Recall Curve'.
    - The axes object allows for further customization of the plot outside the function.

    Requirements:
    - tensorflow.keras
    - sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split
    - sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_curve
    - matplotlib.pyplot

    Examples:
    >>> X = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])
    >>> Y = np.array([[0], [1], [1], [0]])
    >>> model, ax = task_func(X, Y)
    >>> isinstance(model, Sequential)
    True
    >>> isinstance(ax, plt.Axes)
    True
