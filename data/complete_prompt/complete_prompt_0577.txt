def task_func(directory):
    """
    Processes all files within the specified directory, normalizes their filenames to ASCII,
    calculates their MD5 hashes, and retrieves their sizes. It returns a dictionary where
    each key is the normalized file name and each value is another dictionary with the file's size
    and MD5 hash. This method is useful for file integrity checks and file organization tasks.

    Parameters:
    directory (str): The directory path whose files are to be analyzed.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary where each key is a normalized file name, and the value is a dictionary
          containing the 'Size' (in bytes) and 'MD5 Hash' of the file.

    Requirements:
    - os
    - pathlib
    - hashlib.md5
    - unicodedata

    Examples:
    >>> info = task_func('test')
    >>> type(info) == dict
    True
    >>> 'test.txt' in info
    True
