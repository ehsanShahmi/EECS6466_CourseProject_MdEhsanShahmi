def task_func(data, n_components=2, random_state=None):
    """
    Performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the provided dataset to reduce its dimensionality,
    and visualizes the results using a scatter plot.

    This function applies PCA to the dataset, reducing its features to the specified number of principal components.
    It then visualizes the reduced data in a scatter plot. For datasets reduced to a single component, the function
    generates a 1D scatter plot along the X-axis, with all Y-values set to zero. For reductions resulting in two or more
    components, only the first two principal components are visualized.

    Parameters:
    - data (ndarray): A numpy ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features) representing the data.
    - n_components (int, optional): Number of components to keep. Defaults to 2.
    - random_state (int, optional): Seed for reproducibility. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing:
        - "transformed_data" (np.ndarray): The transformed data.
        - "ax" (plt.Axes): The scatter plot visualizing the transformed data.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - sklearn

    Example:
    >>> data = np.random.random((100, 5))
    >>> results = task_func(data, random_state=42)
    >>> results['transformed_data'].shape
    (100, 2)
    >>> type(results['ax'])
    <class 'matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes'>
