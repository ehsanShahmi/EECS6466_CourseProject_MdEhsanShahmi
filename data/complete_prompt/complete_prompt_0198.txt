def task_func(data, value):
    """
    Analyzes a list of numerical data, identifies values greater than the average,
    and counts how many values are greater than a specified value. Additionally, plots the
    histogram of the sorted numbers.

    Parameters:
        data (list): A list of numerical data.
        value (float): A value to compare against the data.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: An array of values from the data that are greater than the average.
        int: The number of values in the data that are greater than the given value.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - bisect
    - statistics
    - matplotlib.pyplot

    Note:
    - If the data list is empty, the function returns an empty numpy.ndarray and a count of 0. This ensures
      the function's output remains consistent and predictable even with no input data.

    Examples:
    >>> greater_avg, count = task_func([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 5)
    >>> greater_avg.tolist()
    [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    >>> count
    5
