    """
    Generate a DataFrame with detailed artificial sensor readings for specified timestamps
    and sensor statuses from a predefined list.

    The function generates sensor readings for Sensor1, Sensor2, and Sensor3 (or their
    corresponding named columns in the supplied column list) using sine, cosine, and tan
    functions, respectively, of the timestamp (converted to seconds), with a small random
    noise added to simulate real sensor data variability.
    SensorStatus is randomly chosen from the provided statuses for each timestamp.

    Parameters:
    - start_time (int): Start time in milliseconds since epoch.
    - end_time (int): End time in milliseconds since epoch. Must not be before start_time.
    - step (int): The interval in milliseconds between each generated data point. Must be positive.
                  This step defines the frequency at which data points are generated. If the step
                  does not neatly divide the interval between start_time and end_time into
                  equal-sized portions, the last timestamp may be excluded.
    - columns (list of str, optional): Names of the DataFrame columns to be included in the output.
                                       Defaults to: ['Timestamp', 'Sensor1', 'Sensor2', 'Sensor3', 'SensorStatus'].
                                       Regardless of naming, the function will populate the first column with
                                       timestamp, the middle columns with sensor data, and the final with status.
    - sensor_statuses (list of str, optional): Possible statuses for the sensors to randomly assign in the dataset.
                                               Defaults to: ['OK', 'MAINTENANCE_REQUIRED', 'ERROR'].
    - random_seed (int, optional): Seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducible results.
                                   Defaults to 42.

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: Generated sensor readings for the given timestamps.
