def task_func(url: str, file_name: str = "Output.txt") -> str:
    """
    Scrape the 'title' from a specified web page, save it in JSON format to a given file, 
    and append to the file if it exists.`

    Parameters:
    - url (str): The URL of the web page from which the title is to be scraped.
    - file_name (str, optional): The name of the file to save the scraped title. 
    If the file already exists, the new data is appended. Defaults to 'Output.txt'.

    Returns:
    - str: The file path where the scraped title is saved.

    Requirements:
    - requests
    - json
    - bs4

    Notes:
    - If the web page does not have a title, 'None' is saved as the title value in the JSON data.
    - Data is appended to the specified file in JSON format, with each title on a new line.

    Example:
    >>> task_func("http://example.com")
    'Output.txt'
    >>> task_func("http://another-example.com", "AnotherOutput.txt")
    'AnotherOutput.txt'
