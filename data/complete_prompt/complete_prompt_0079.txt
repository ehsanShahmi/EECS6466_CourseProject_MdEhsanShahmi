def task_func(request, file_paths):
    """
    Generates a ZIP file response for a Django HttpRequest, zipping the specified files. This function is useful

    Parameters:
    - request (HttpRequest): The incoming Django HttpRequest, not used within the function.
    - file_paths (list of str): A list of file paths or file contents to be included in the zip.

    Returns:
    - FileResponse: A Django FileResponse object containing the ZIP file as an attachment.

    Requirements:
    - django.http
    - django.conf
    - zipfile
    - io

    Examples:
    >>> from django.conf import settings
    >>> if not settings.configured:
    ...     settings.configure()  # Add minimal necessary settings
    >>> from django.http import HttpRequest
    >>> request = HttpRequest()
    >>> response = task_func(request)
    >>> response['Content-Type']
    'application/zip'
    >>> request = HttpRequest()
    >>> response = task_func(request)
    >>> response['Content-Disposition']
