    """
    Create a "shopping cart" (Counter object) for each list in list_of_lists. 
    The items in the cart are randomly selected from a predefined list of possible items (POSSIBLE_ITEMS).
    The frequency of each item in the cart corresponds to the length of the list.

    Parameters:
    - list_of_lists (list): A list of lists, each representing a 'basket'.

    Returns:
    - baskets (list): A list of Counters, each representing a 'shopping cart'.

    Requirements:
    - collections
    - random

    Example:
    >>> baskets = task_func([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]])
    >>> all(isinstance(basket, Counter) for basket in baskets) # Illustrative, actual items will vary due to randomness
    True
    >>> sum(len(basket) for basket in baskets) # The sum of lengths of all baskets; illustrative example
