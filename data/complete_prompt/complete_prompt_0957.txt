def task_func(text: str) -> tuple:
    """
    Counts the number of words, characters, and unique characters in a given text.

    Parameters:
    - text (str): The input text to be analyzed.

    Returns:
    - tuple: A tuple containing three integers: the number of words,
                                                the number of characters,
                                                the number of unique characters.

    Requirements:
    - string
    - re

    Note:
    - This function considers whitespace-separated substrings as words.
    - When counting characters, this function excludes whitespace and special
      characters (i.e. string.punctuation).

    Example:
    >>> task_func('Hello, world!')
    (2, 10, 7)
    >>> task_func('Python is  awesome!  ')
    (3, 15, 12)
