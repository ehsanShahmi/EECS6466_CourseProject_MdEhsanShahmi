def task_func(json_string):
    """
    Process a JSON string containing a "text" field: convert to lowercase, remove punctuation, and count word frequency.

    This function takes a JSON string with a field named "text", and returns a dictionary with word counts. 
    It processes the text by converting it to lowercase, removing all punctuation and non-alphanumeric characters 
    (except spaces), and then counting the frequency of each word.

    Parameters:
    - json_string (str): A JSON string with a "text" field to process.

    Returns:
    - dict: A dictionary with words as keys and their frequency counts as values. If the "text" field is missing, 
      returns an empty dictionary.

    Requirements:
    - re
    - json
    - collections
    - string

    Example:
    >>> json_input = '{"text": "Hello world! Hello universe. World, meet universe."}'
    >>> task_func(json_input)
    {'hello': 2, 'world': 2, 'universe': 2, 'meet': 1}

    Notes:
    - Punctuation is removed using the `string.punctuation` constant.
    - The function is case-insensitive and treats words like "Hello" and "hello" as the same word.
    - If the JSON string is malformed or the "text" field is missing, an empty dictionary is returned.
