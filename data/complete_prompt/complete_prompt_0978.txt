def task_func(array, seed=None):
    """
    Shuffles the columns of a numpy array randomly, performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    to reduce the dimensionality to 2 principal components, and returns these components as a pandas DataFrame.

    Parameters:
    - array (numpy.ndarray): A 2D numpy array where each row is an observation and each column is a feature.
    - seed (int, optional): Seed for the random number generator. Defaults to None (not set).

    Returns:
    - pandas.DataFrame: DataFrame with columns 'PC1' and 'PC2' representing the two principal components.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If the input array is not 2D.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - sklearn

    Note:
    - PCA reduction will default to the number of features if fewer than 2.
    - An named but empty DataFrame is returned for arrays without features or with empty content.

    Examples:
    >>> array = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
    >>> df = task_func(array, seed=42)
    >>> df["PC1"]
    0    5.59017
    1   -5.59017
    Name: PC1, dtype: float64
    >>> df.shape
    (2, 2)
