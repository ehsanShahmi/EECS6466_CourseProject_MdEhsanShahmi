def task_func(file_path):
    """
    Generates RSA public and private keys and uses Fernet symmetric encryption to encrypt the contents
    of a specified file. The Fernet key is then encrypted with the public RSA key. The encrypted file
    contents and the encrypted Fernet key are saved in separate files.

    This method demonstrates a hybrid encryption approach where symmetric encryption is used for the file
    contents and asymmetric encryption for the encryption key.

    Parameters:
    file_path (str): The path to the file to be encrypted.

    Returns:
    PublicKey: The RSA public key.
    str: The filename of the encrypted file.
    str: The filename of the file containing the encrypted Fernet key.

    Requirements:
    - rsa
    - cryptography.fernet.Fernet
    - base64.b64encode

    Examples:
    >>> pub_key, encrypted_file, encrypted_key_file = task_func('my_file.txt')
    >>> len(pub_key.save_pkcs1()) > 100
    True
    >>> encrypted_file.endswith('.encrypted')
    True
    >>> encrypted_key_file.endswith('.encrypted')
    True
