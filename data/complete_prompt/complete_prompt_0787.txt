def task_func(array1, array2):
    """
    Calculate the maximum Euclidean distance between all possible pairs of points 
    formed by combining elements from two input arrays.

    Each point is formed by combining one element from the first array and one 
    element from the second array. The function then calculates the Euclidean 
    distance between each pair of points and returns the maximum distance found.

    Parameters:
    - array1 (numpy.array): A one-dimensional numpy array.
    - array2 (numpy.array): A one-dimensional numpy array. The length of array2 should be 
                          the same as array1.

    Returns:
    - max_distance (float): The maximum Euclidean distance between any two points formed by combining 
           elements from array1 and array2. If the arrays are empty, the function
           returns 0.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If the input arrays have different lengths.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - itertools

    Example:
    >>> array1 = np.array([2, 3, 4])
    >>> array2 = np.array([1, 5, 2])
    >>> task_func(array1, array2)
