def task_func():
    """
    Generate a DataFrame representing monthly sales of products and visualize the total sales.

    The function creates a DataFrame where each row represents a month, each column represents a product,
    and cell values represent sales figures. It then plots the total sales per product across all months
    using both a line plot and a heatmap for visualization.

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with randomly generated sales figures for each product over 12 months.

    The function also displays:
    - A line plot showing the total sales per product.
    - A heatmap visualizing sales figures across products and months.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib.pyplot
    - seaborn

    Example:
    >>> df = task_func()
    >>> df.shape
    (12, 5)
    >>> all(df.columns == PRODUCTS)
    True
    >>> all(df.index == MONTHS)
    True
    >>> (df.values >= 100).all() and (df.values <= 1000).all()
    True
