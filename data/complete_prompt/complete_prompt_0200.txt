def task_func(n, value):
    """
    Generates 'n' random numbers between 0 and 1, finds those greater than their average,
    and counts how many are greater than or equal to a specified value, then plots 
    the sorted numbers.

    Parameters:
        n (int): The number of random numbers to generate.
        value (float): The value to compare against the random numbers.

    Returns:
        list: Numbers greater than the average of all generated numbers.
        int: The count of numbers greater than or equal to the specified value.

    Requirements:
    - random
    - bisect
    - statistics
    - matplotlib.pyplot

    Examples:
    >>> greater_avg, count = task_func(10, 0.5)
    >>> isinstance(greater_avg, list) and isinstance(count, int)
    True
    >>> len(greater_avg) <= 10
    True
