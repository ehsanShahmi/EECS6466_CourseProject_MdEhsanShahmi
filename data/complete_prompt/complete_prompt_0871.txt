def task_func(data_list, file_name):
    """
    This function takes a list of tuples. The first value of each tuple is a string,
    the other values are numeric. E.g. ('test', 2, 12.4, -2)
    It calculates the mean over all tuples of the numerical values for each tuple position excluding the first position, 
    and writes the results into a specified text file.
    The content in the text file is formated as follows:
    'Position 'x': 'mean', where x is the current tuple position and 'mean' denotes the 
    computed mean value. Each Position is written in a new line.
    It returns a list of the calculated mean values.

    Missing values and non numeric values at positions other than the first are filled / replaced with np.nan. 
    If an empty list is handed to the function an empty list is returned and an empty file is created.

    The function utilizes the 'numpy' library for numerical operations and the 'itertools' library 
    to handle the iteration through the data structure.

    Parameters:
    - data_list (list of tuples): A list containing tuples of the form (string, numeric, numeric, ...)
    - file_name (str): The name of the text file to store the mean values.

    Returns:
    - list: A list of mean values calculated from the numerical data in the tuples.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - itertools

    Example:
    >>> data = [('a', 1, 2), ('b', 2, 3), ('c', 3, 4), ('d', 4, 5), ('e', 5, 6)]
    >>> task_func(data, 'mean_values.txt')
    [3.0, 4.0]
    >>> with open('mean_values.txt') as file:
    ...    txt_content = file.readlines()
    >>> print(txt_content)
    ['Position 1: 3.0\\n', 'Position 2: 4.0\\n']
    >>> data_list=[('hi', 'test', -12, 4), ('hallo', 1.2, 'test'), ('hola', -3, 34, 12.1)]
    >>> task_func(data_list, 'test.txt')
    [-0.9, 11.0, 8.05]
    >>> with open('test.txt') as file:
    ...     txt_content = file.readlines()
    >>> print(txt_content)
    ['Position 1: -0.9\\n', 'Position 2: 11.0\\n', 'Position 3: 8.05\\n']
