def task_func(df, n_clusters=3, random_state=None, n_init=10):
    """
    Identify duplicate points in a DataFrame, perform KMeans clustering on the unique points,
    and record the clusters.

    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing at least two columns 'x' and 'y' representing points.
    n_clusters (int, optional): Number of clusters for KMeans clustering. Default is 3.
    random_state (int, optional): The seed used by the random number generator for reproducibility. Default is None.
    n_init (int, optional): Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different centroid seeds.
                            The final results will be the best output of n_init consecutive runs in terms of
                            within-cluster sum of squares. Default is 10.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - Counter: A Counter object with the count of duplicate points.
        - pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with an additional column 'cluster' representing cluster assignments for unique points.
        - Axes: A scatter plot of the clustered data.

    Requirements:
    - collections.Counter
    - sklearn.cluster.KMeans
    - matplotlib.pyplot

    Example:
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame({\
            'x': [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4],\
            'y': [1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3]\
        })
    >>> duplicates, df_clustered, ax = task_func(df, random_state=42)
    >>> df_clustered
       x  y  cluster
    0  1  1        2
    1  2  1        0
    4  3  3        1
    5  4  3        1
    >>> duplicates
    Counter({(2, 1): 3})
