def task_func(text):
    """
    Extracts all names from a given text string that are not surrounded by square brackets 
    and counts the frequency of each extracted name. It then creates a bar chart of the name frequencies and
    returns the name frequencies as a pandas Series and the bar chart plot's axes object along with the skewness 
    and kurtosis of the name frequencies. If the skewness and kurtosis are nan, they are returned as None.
    
    Parameters:
    text (str): The text from which to extract names. Each name should be separated by square brackets containing addresses.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - pd.Series: A pandas Series with the frequency of each name.
        - Axes: A bar chart plot showing the name frequencies. If no names are found, this will be None.
        - float: The skewness of the name frequencies.
        - float: The kurtosis of the name frequencies.

    Example:
    >>> text_input = "Josie Smith [3996 COLLEGE AVENUE, SOMETOWN, MD 21003]Mugsy Dog Smith [2560 OAK ST, GLENMEADE, WI 14098]"
    >>> name_freqs, plot, skew, kurtosis = task_func(text_input)
    >>> print(list(name_freqs.items())[0])
    ('Josie Smith', 1)
    >>> type(plot)
    <class 'matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes'>
    >>> round(kurtosis, 2) is not None
    True
