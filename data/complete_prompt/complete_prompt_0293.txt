def task_func(elements, subset_size):
    """
    Generate all subsets of a given size from a tuple and draw a histogram of the sums of the subsets. Additionally,
    return the Axes object of the plotted histogram and the combinations of the subsets and their sums.

    Parameters:
    - elements (tuple): A tuple of integers for which subsets will be generated.
    - subset_size (int): Size of the subsets to be generated.

    Returns:
    - matplotlib.axes.Axes: Axes object of the plotted histogram.
    - list: List of all the combinations of subsets.
    - list: List of the sums of all the subsets.

    Requirements:
    - itertools
    - numpy
    - matplotlib

    Example:
    >>> ax, combs, sums = task_func((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), 2)
    >>> type(ax)
    <class 'matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes'>
    >>> len(combs)
    45
    >>> len(sums)
    45
