def task_func(

):
    """
    Generate and plot a performance trend for different teams from a given epoch timestamp to the current time.

    The performance data is generated by creating a series of random values for each day from the starting timestamp
    to the present day. Each team's performance is simulated as a random float between 0.1 and 1 for each day.
    The plot shows days since the start date on the x-axis and performance on the y-axis.

    Parameters:
    epoch_milliseconds (int): The epoch milliseconds from where to start the generation. Must not be in the future.
    teams (list of str, optional): Team names. If not provided, defaults to ['Team1', 'Team2', 'Team3', 'Team4', 'Team5'].
    random_seed (int, optional): Seed for random number generation to ensure reproducibility. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing performance data for each team, with days as indices and performance as float values.
    matplotlib.figure.Figure: A figure object showing the performance trend of each team over the days.

    Requirements:
    - datetime.datetime
    - random
    - matplotlib

    Example:
    >>> results, ax = task_func(1236472051807)
    >>> results.keys()
    dict_keys(['Team1', 'Team2', 'Team3', 'Team4', 'Team5'])
    >>> type(ax)
    <class 'matplotlib.figure.Figure'>
