def task_func(l, n_groups = 5):
    """
    Generate a Series from a list "l". The function shuffles the list, 
    then creates a longer series by cycling through the shuffled list. 
    For each element in the series, it randomly selects n_groups characters
    from the start of the string and moves them to the end. 
    
    Parameters:
    - l (list): A list of strings.
    - n_groups (int): number of groups. Default value is 5.

    Returns:
    - pd.Series: A Series where each element is modified by moving "n" 
                 characters from the start to the end.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - random.shuffle
    - random.randint

    Example:
    >>> result = task_func(['ABC', 'DEF', 'GHI'])
    >>> isinstance(result, pd.Series)  # Check if the output is a pandas Series
    True
    >>> len(result) == 15  # Check if the length of the result is as expected for 3 elements cycled 5 times
    True
