def task_func(categories=None, months=None, random_seed=42):
    """
    Generates a DataFrame with simulated monthly sales data for various product categories, ensuring reproducibility through the use of a random seed.

    Parameters:
        categories (list of str, optional): A list specifying the product categories to include in the report. If not provided, defaults to ['Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home & Kitchen', 'Books', 'Beauty & Personal Care'].
        months (list of str, optional): A list specifying the months to include in the report. If not provided, defaults to ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December'].
        random_seed (int, optional): The seed value for the random number generator to ensure the reproducibility of the sales data. Defaults to 42.

    Returns:
        pandas.DataFrame: A DataFrame with three columns: 'Month', 'Category', and 'Sales'. The 'Sales' values are floating-point numbers in the range [100, 501), generated by the formula: randint(100, 500) + uniform(0, 1), ensuring sales values are diverse yet consistent upon repeated executions with the same seed.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If either 'categories' or 'months' is not provided as a list or if either is an empty list.

    Notes:
        - The function sets the random seed at the beginning of execution to ensure that the generated sales data is the same for any given seed value.
        - The sales data for each category is generated for each month, creating a comprehensive report that spans all specified categories and months.

    Requirements:
    - pandas 
    - random

    Example:
        >>> report = task_func()
        >>> print(report.head())
             Month                Category       Sales
        0  January             Electronics  427.111331
        1  January                Clothing  479.275029
        2  January          Home & Kitchen  214.139538
        3  January                   Books  152.676699
        4  January  Beauty & Personal Care  379.086939
