def task_func(host):
    """
    This function resolves the IP address of the given host and then uses the IP address 
    to fetch geolocation information from the ipinfo.io API. The function is robust against
    various common errors, such as invalid hostnames, network issues, or problems with the 
    geolocation service.

    Parameters:
    host (str): The hostname to be resolved.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing the IP address and geolocation information if successful.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If 'host' is None or an empty string.
    ConnectionError: If there is a problem connecting to the geolocation service.

    Example:
    >>> result = task_func('google.com')
    >>> 'ip_address' in result and 'geolocation' in result
    True
    >>> task_func('')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
    ValueError: Host must be a non-empty string.
