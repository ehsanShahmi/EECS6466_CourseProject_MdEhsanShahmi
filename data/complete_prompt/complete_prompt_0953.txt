def task_func(mystrings, folder_path, seed=None):
    """
    Generates random data points to plot bar charts for each in a given list of plot names,
    then saves them in a specified directory.

    This function takes a list of plot names, for each generating 10 random data points in [0, 1)
    to create a bar chart, then saves the bar charts as .png files in the specified directory,
    creating the directory if it does not exist.

    Parameters:
    - mystrings (list of str): List of names for the plots.
                               Each is used as the title for each plot, and each is used to derive
                               each plot's filename by replacing spaces with underscores.
    - folder_path (str):       Path of the folder where the plots will be saved.
                               If it does not exist, the function will create it.
    - seed (int, optional):    A seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducible results.
                               Defaults to None.

    Returns:
    - list: Names of the files where the plots are saved. Each file corresponds to a title from `mystrings`.

    Raises:
    - FileNotFoundError: If the provided directory path does not exist and cannot be created.

    Note:
    - This function deduplicates mystrings while maintaining its original order.
    - Random data points for bar charts are generated in the range [0, 1).
    - Each bar chart contains 10 data points.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - os

    Examples:
    >>> task_func(['Plot 1', 'Plot 2'], './test_images/')
    ['Plot_1.png', 'Plot_2.png']

    >>> task_func(['First Plot', 'Second Plot'], './another_folder/')
    ['First_Plot.png', 'Second_Plot.png']
