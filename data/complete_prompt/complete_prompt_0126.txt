def task_func(animals=None, seed=42):
    """
    Create a report on the number of animals in a zoo. For each animal, generate a random count within 
    a specified range, calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of these counts, and return 
    a DataFrame with these statistics. Additionally, generate a bar chart of the counts.

    Parameters:
    - animals (list of str, optional): List of animals to include in the report. 
        Defaults to ['Lion', 'Elephant', 'Tiger', 'Giraffe', 'Panda'].
    - seed (int, optional): Random seed for reproducibility. Defaults to 42.

    Returns:
    - DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with columns ['Animal', 'Mean', 'Median', 'Standard Deviation'].
      Each animal's count is randomly generated 10 times within the range 1 to 100, inclusive.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - random
    - statistics
    - numpy

    Example:
    >>> report = task_func()
    >>> print(report)
         Animal  Mean  Median  Mode  Standard Deviation
    0      Lion  42.0    30.5    95           33.250564
    1  Elephant  44.4    41.5    12           34.197076
    2     Tiger  61.1    71.0    30           28.762649
    3   Giraffe  51.8    54.5    54           29.208903
    4     Panda  35.8    32.0    44           24.595935

    Note: The mode is not included in the returned DataFrame due to the possibility of no repeating values 
    in the randomly generated counts.
