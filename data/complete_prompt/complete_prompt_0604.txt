def task_func(filepath):
    """
    Attempts to compile a existing C++ file specified by 'filepath'. The output of the compilation process
    is logged, indicating whether the compilation was successful or not. This function is useful
    for automating the compilation of C++ code and tracking compilation results.
    The log should indicate whether the compilation was successful or if an error occurred.

    Parameters:
    filepath (str): The path of the C++ file to be compiled.

    Returns:
    None: This function does not return anything but logs the outcome of the compilation process.

    Raises:
    - subprocess.CalledProcessError: If the compilation process fails.
    - FileNotFoundError: If the compiler is not found or the specified file does not exist.

    Requirements:
    - subprocess
    - logging

    Examples:
    >>> import os
    >>> with open('example.cpp', 'w') as f: \
            _ = f.write("int main(){return 0;}")
    >>> task_func('example.cpp')
    >>> os.path.exists('example')
    True
