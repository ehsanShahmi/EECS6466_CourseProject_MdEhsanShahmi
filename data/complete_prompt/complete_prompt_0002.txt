def task_func(LETTERS):
    """
    Create a dictionary in which keys are random letters and values are lists of random integers.
    The dictionary is then sorted by the mean of the values in descending order, demonstrating the use of the statistics library.
    
    Parameters:
        LETTERS (list of str): A list of characters used as keys for the dictionary.
    
    Returns:
    dict: The sorted dictionary with letters as keys and lists of integers as values, sorted by their mean values.
    
    Requirements:
    - random
    - statistics
    
    Example:
    >>> import random
    >>> random.seed(42)
    >>> sorted_dict = task_func(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    >>> list(sorted_dict.keys())
    ['a', 'b', 'c']
    >>> isinstance(sorted_dict['a'], list)
    True
    >>> type(sorted_dict['a'])  # Check type of values
    <class 'list'>
