def task_func(dic):
    """
    Generates a Folium map with markers for specified locations. It preprocesses the input to handle
    both direct geographical coordinates and address strings. For address strings, it dynamically resolves
    their latitude and longitude using the Photon geolocation service. This flexible input handling
    allows for easy mapping of various location types.

    Parameters:
        dic (dict): A dictionary with location names as keys. Each key can either map to a dictionary
                    {'Lat': latitude, 'Lon': longitude} for direct coordinates, or to a string indicating
                    the location's address for geolocation lookup using Photon.

    Returns:
        folium.Map: A Folium map object with markers for each specified location.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - folium
    - geopy.geocoders.Photon

    Notes:
    - The geolocator, instantiated as Photon(user_agent="geoapiExercises"), plays a crucial role in enabling
    the function to handle string addresses by converting them into latitude and longitude, thus broadening
    the scope of input data that can be mapped.

    Examples:
    >>> locations = {'Place1': {'Lat': 0, 'Lon': 0}, 'Place2': 'New York, USA'}
    >>> result = task_func(locations)
    >>> isinstance(result, folium.Map)
    True
    >>> [0.0, 0.0] == result.location
    True
