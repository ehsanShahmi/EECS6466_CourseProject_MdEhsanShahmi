def task_func(amplitude, frequency, time):
    """
    Generates and plots a complex wave with a specified amplitude and frequency over given time points,
    applying a Hann window to reduce edge effects. The wave is represented as a complex number where the real part 
    is the cosine component, and the imaginary part is the sine component. It returns both the wave and the plot object.

    Parameters:
        amplitude (float): The amplitude of the complex wave.
        frequency (float): The frequency of the complex wave.
        time (numpy.ndarray): The time points to generate the wave.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The generated complex wave as a numpy array of complex numbers.
        matplotlib.figure.Figure: The figure object of the plot.
        matplotlib.axes.Axes: The axes object of the plot.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - math
    - matplotlib.pyplot
    - scipy.signal.get_window

    Notes:
    - The plot title is "Complex Wave with Hann Window".
    - The x-label of the plot is "Time".
    - The y-label of the plot is "Amplitude".
    - The plot displays both the real and imaginary parts of the complex wave.

    Examples:
    >>> wave, fig, ax = task_func(1, 1, np.linspace(0, 1, 10, endpoint=False))
    >>> len(wave) == 10
    True
    >>> isinstance(wave[0], complex)
    True
