def task_func(s: str) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Vectorize a string using the Bag-of-Words model. The string is split into words and each word is treated as an attribute. The value of each attribute is the number of occurrences of the word in the string. The function also uses some predefined sentences (SENTENCES constant) for vectorization.

    Parameters:
    - s (str): The string to vectorize.

    Returns:
    - np.ndarray: A numpy array with the vectorized string.

    Requirements:
    - re
    - sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer
    - numpy

    Example:
    >>> s = 'This is a test string.'
    >>> vec = task_func(s)
    >>> print(vec)
    [0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1]
