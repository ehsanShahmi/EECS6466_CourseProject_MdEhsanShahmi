def task_func(file_path, unknown_key):
    """
    Reads a JSON file, extracts a value specified by an 'unknown_key' within a nested structure, hashes this value using SHA256,
    and writes the base64-encoded hash to a new file with a timestamp in its name. The JSON should contain a specific 
    structure where the value to be hashed is under 'A' -> [unknown_key] -> 'maindata' -> [index 0] -> 'Info'.

    Parameters:
    - file_path (str): The file path to read the JSON data from.
    - unknown_key (str): The key to look for in the nested JSON structure under the top-level key 'A'. This key should 
                         lead to a list of dictionaries under 'maindata', with the first dictionary containing the 'Info' key.

    Returns:
    str: The absolute file path of the newly created file containing the hashed value.
    
    Requirements:
    - json
    - os
    - hashlib
    - base64
    - time
    
    Example:
    >>> json_file = '/path/to/file.json'
    >>> new_file = task_func(json_file, 'B')
    >>> print(f"Hashed data saved at: {new_file}")
