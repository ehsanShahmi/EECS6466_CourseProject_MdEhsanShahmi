def task_func():
    """
    Create a numeric array of random integers, calculate the mean and standard deviation, and draw a histogram of the distribution.

    Note:
        The random integers are generated between 1 and 100. The title of the histogram is "Histogram of Random Integers". 
        The x-axis is labeled "Value" and the y-axis is labeled "Frequency". 
        The mean is plotted as a red dashed line, and the standard deviation is plotted as purple dashed lines.
        
    Returns:
    Tuple: A tuple containing the array, mean, standard deviation, and the histogram plot (Axes).

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - matplotlib.pyplot
    
    Example:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.random.seed(0)
    >>> array, mean, std, ax = task_func()
    >>> print(mean, std)
    49.6135 28.5323416100046
    >>> plt.show()
