def task_func(s1, s2, n_clusters=3):
    """
    Perform K-Means clustering on data points from two pandas Series and visualize the clusters.

    Parameters:
    - s1 (pandas.Series): The first series of data. Each value in the series represents a data point's coordinate along one dimension.
    - s2 (pandas.Series): The second series of data. Each value corresponds to a data point's coordinate along another dimension. The length of s2 must match that of s1.
    - n_clusters (int, optional): The number of clusters to form as well as the number of centroids to generate. Defaults to 3.

    Returns:
    - tuple: A tuple containing the following elements:
        - ndarray: An array of cluster labels indicating the cluster each data point belongs to.
        - matplotlib.axes.Axes: The Axes object of the plot, which shows the data points colored according to their cluster labels.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If either s1 or s2 is not a pandas Series, raise "s1 and s2 must be pandas Series"
    - ValueError: If s1 and s2 have different lengths, raise "s1 and s2 must have the same length"

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - scikit-learn
    - matplotlib

    Notes:
    - The function needs to ensure that s1 and s2 are pandas Series of equal length. 
    - It then performs K-Means clustering on the combined data points from s1 and s2. 
    - After clustering, it creates a scatter plot where each cluster is visualized with a different color. 
    - The plot title is set to "K-Means Clustering" to describe the visualization technique. 
    - A legend is added, which uses elements from the scatter plot to describe each cluster.
        
    Example:
    >>> s1 = pd.Series(np.random.rand(100), name='feature1')
    >>> s2 = pd.Series(np.random.rand(100), name='feature2')
    >>> labels, ax = task_func(s1, s2, n_clusters=4)
    >>> print(ax.get_title())
    K-Means Clustering
