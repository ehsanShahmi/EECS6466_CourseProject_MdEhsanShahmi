def task_func(x=1):
    """
    Draw x random 5-card poker hands from a 52-card pack (without suits) and return
    the hands along with a counter of the drawn cards.

    Parameters:
    x (int, optional): Number of hands to draw. Default is 1.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing two elements:
        - list of list str: Each inner list contains 5 strings, representing a 5-card poker hand.
        - Counter: A counter of the drawn cards.


    The output is random; hence, the returned list will vary with each call.

    Requirements:
    - random
    - collections.Counter

    Example:
    >>> random.seed(0)
    >>> result = task_func(1)
    >>> len(result[0][0])
    5
    >>> result[0][0][0] in CARDS
    True
