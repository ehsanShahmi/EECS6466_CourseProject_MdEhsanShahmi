def task_func(url):
    """
    Fetches an image from a given URL and returns it as a PIL Image object.

    Parameters:
    - url (str): The URL of the image to download. It should be a valid HTTP or
      HTTPS URL pointing directly to an image file.

    Returns:
    - PIL.Image.Image: A PIL Image object representing the downloaded image. This
      object can be manipulated or displayed using PIL's image processing
      capabilities.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: This exception is raised in the following scenarios:
        - The URL is invalid or cannot be reached within the timeout period (5 seconds).
        - The response from the server is not a successful HTTP status code (i.e., not in the range 200-299).
        - The content fetched from the URL is not a valid image format that can be handled by PIL.

    Requirements:
    - requests
    - PIL
    - io

    Example:
    >>> img = task_func('https://example.com/image.jpg')
    >>> isinstance(img, Image.Image)
    True

    Note:
    - The function uses a timeout of 5 seconds for the HTTP request to prevent
      indefinite waiting in case of unresponsive URLs.
    - The function will not handle redirections or authentication scenarios. It
      expects a direct link to an image resource.
