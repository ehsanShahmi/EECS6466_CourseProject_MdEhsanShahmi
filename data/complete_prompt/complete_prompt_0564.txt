def task_func(filepath):
    """
    Loads a DLL file from the specified filepath and returns its metadata, including creation time,
    modification time, and file size. The times are displayed in UTC format. This function
    demonstrates the use of ctypes for loading DLLs and os module for accessing file metadata.

    
    Parameters:
    filepath (str): The path of the DLL file.

    Returns:
    str: The name of the loaded DLL file.
    dict: A dictionary containing the metadata of the DLL file, including the keys 'Creation Time', 'Modification Time', and 'Size'.
    
    Requirements:
    - ctypes
    - os
    - datetime.datetime
    - pytz

    Examples:
    >>> isinstance(task_func('libc.so.6'), str) # Doctest will vary based on the system and DLL file availability.
    True
    >>> 'libc.so.6' in task_func('libc.so.6')
    True
