def task_func(goals, penalties):
    """
    Calculates net scores for teams ('Team A' to 'Team E') by subtracting penalties from goals and clips scores to stay
    within -10 to 10. Visualizes results with a bar chart showing each team's adjusted scores 'Team' on the x-axis and
    score values 'Score' on the y-axis.


    Parameters:
    - goals (dict): A dictionary where keys are team names and values are the number of goals scored.
    - penalties (dict): A dictionary where keys are team names and values are the number of penalties incurred.

    Returns:
    - DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with columns 'Team' and 'Score', representing each team's net score.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib

    Example:
    >>> goals = {'Team A': 5, 'Team B': 3, 'Team C': 1, 'Team D': 0, 'Team E': 4}
    >>> penalties = {'Team A': 1, 'Team B': 1, 'Team C': 1, 'Team D': 0, 'Team E': 2}
    >>> df = task_func(goals, penalties)
    >>> print(df)
         Team  Score
    0  Team A      4
    1  Team B      2
    2  Team C      0
    3  Team D      0
