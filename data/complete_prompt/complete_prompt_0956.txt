def task_func(text: str, seed=None) -> str:
    """
    Transforms a given string by removing special characters, normalizing whitespace,
    and randomizing character casing.

    Parameters:
    - text (str): The text string to be preprocessed.
    - seed (int, optional): Random seed for reproducibility. Defaults to None (not set).

    Returns:
    - str: The preprocessed text string.

    Requirements:
    - re
    - string
    - random

    Note:
    - This function considers special characters to be string punctuations.
    - Spaces, tabs, and newlines are replaced with with '_', '__', and '___' respectively.
    - To randomize casing, this function converts characters to uppercase with a 50% probability.

    Example:
    >>> task_func('Hello   World!', 0)
    'HeLlo___WORlD'
    >>> task_func('attention is all you need', 42)
    'ATtENTIOn_IS_ALL_You_Need'
