    Plots a histogram of normalized data from an input 2D numpy array alongside the probability density function (PDF)
    of a standard normal distribution.

    Note:
    - Takes in a 2D numpy array as input.
    - Calculates the sum of elements in each row of the array.
    - Normalizes these row sums to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
      - Normalization is achieved by first calculating the mean and standard deviation of the row sums.
      - Each row sum is then transformed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
      - If the standard deviation is 0 (indicating all row sums are equal), normalization results in an array of zeros with the same shape.
    - Plots a histogram of the normalized data.
      - Uses 30 bins for the histogram.
      - The histogram is density-based, meaning it represents the probability density rather than raw frequencies.
      - The bars of the histogram are semi-transparent (60% opacity) and green in color.
    - Overlays the PDF of a standard normal distribution on the histogram for comparison.
      - The PDF curve is plotted in red with a line width of 2.
      - The range of the PDF curve is set to cover 99% of a standard normal distribution.
    - Sets the title of the plot to "Histogram of Normalized Data with Standard Normal PDF".

    Parameters:
    - arr: A 2D numpy array. The array should contain numerical data.

    Returns:
    - A tuple containing:
      - A matplotlib Axes object with the histogram of the normalized data and the overlaid standard normal PDF.
      - The normalized data as a 1D numpy array.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - matplotlib

    Example:
    >>> ax, normalized_data = task_func(np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]))
    >>> type(ax)
    <class 'matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes'>
    >>> print(normalized_data)
    [-1.22474487  0.          1.22474487]
