def task_func(mu, sigma, sample_size):
    """
    Generates a numpy array of random samples drawn from a normal distribution
    and plots the histogram of these samples. This function specifies the mean (mu), 
    standard deviation (sigma), and sample size (sample_size), making it useful 
    for simulating data, conducting statistical experiments, or initializing 
    algorithms that require normally distributed data with visualization.

    Parameters:
        mu (float): The mean of the normal distribution.
        sigma (float): The standard deviation of the normal distribution.
        sample_size (int): The number of samples to draw from the distribution.

    Returns:
        ndarray: A numpy array of shape (sample_size,) containing samples drawn from the
                 specified normal distribution.

    Notes:
        Plots a histogram of the generated samples to show the distribution. The histogram
        features:
        - X-axis labeled "Sample values", representing the value of the samples.
        - Y-axis labeled "Frequency", showing how often each value occurs.
        - Title "Histogram of Generated Samples", describing the content of the graph.
        - Number of bins set to 30, to discretize the sample data into 30 intervals.
        - Alpha value of 0.75 for bin transparency, making the histogram semi-transparent.
        - Color 'blue', giving the histogram a blue color.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - matplotlib.pyplot

    Examples:
    >>> data = task_func(0, 1, 1000)
    >>> len(data)
    1000
    >>> isinstance(data, np.ndarray)
    True
