def task_func(goals, penalties, teams=TEAMS, penalties_costs=PENALTIES_COSTS):
    """
    Generates a performance report DataFrame for teams, detailing goals and penalties. For each team, the function fetches
    goal and penalty counts, calculates 'Penalties Cost' using a random multiplier from a predefined list, and computes
    a 'Performance Score' as the non-negative difference between goals and penalties. Return a Dataframe with colomns 'Team',
    'Goals', 'Penalties', 'Penalties Cost' and 'Performance Score'.

    Parameters:
    - goals (dict): Team names as keys, numbers of goals scored as values.
    - penalties (dict): Team names as keys, numbers of penalties incurred as values.
    - teams (list, optioanl): input teams. Default value is ['Team A', 'Team B', 'Team C', 'Team D', 'Team E']
    - penalties_costs (list, optional): input penalties_costs. Default value is [100, 200, 300, 400, 500].

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: DataFrame with Team, Goals, Penalties, Penalties Cost, Performance Score.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - random.choice

    Example:
    >>> goals = {'Team A': 3, 'Team B': 2}
    >>> penalties = {'Team A': 1, 'Team B': 0}
    >>> report = task_func(goals, penalties)
