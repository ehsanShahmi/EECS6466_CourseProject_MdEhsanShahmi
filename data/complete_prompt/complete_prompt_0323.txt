def task_func(text, num_gaussians=1, seed=42):
    '''
    Extract names from a string that aren't enclosed by square brackets, 
    tokenize the names into words, and count the frequency of each word.
    Finally, fit a mixture of num_gaussians 1-D Gaussian distributions to 
    the word frequencies and return the means and variances of the fitted 
    Gaussians.
    
    Parameters:
    text (str): The text from which to extract names and count word frequencies.
    num_gaussians (int, Optional): The number of Gaussian distributions to fit to 
                                   the word frequencies. Defaults to 1.
    seed (int, Optional): The seed for the random number generator. Defaults to 42.
    
    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary with the frequency of each word.
    
    Requirements:
    - re module for regular expression operations.
    - numpy for setting the random seed.
    - collections.Counter for counting word frequencies.
    - scipy.stats.gmm for fitting Gaussian mixture models.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If num_gaussians is less than or equal to 0.
    Exception: If num_gaussians is greater than the number of unique words.
    
    Examples:
    >>> freqs, means = task_func("Josie Smith [3996 COLLEGE AVENUE, SOMETOWN, MD 21003]Mugsy Dog Smith [2560 OAK ST, GLENMEADE, WI 14098]")
    >>> freqs
    {'Josie': 1, 'Smith': 2, 'Mugsy': 1, 'Dog': 1}
