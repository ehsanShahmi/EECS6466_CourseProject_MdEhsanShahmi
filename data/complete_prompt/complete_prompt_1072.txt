def task_func(list_of_lists):
    """
    Generate a list of pandas Series objects, where each Series is indexed by the elements of a sub-list from `list_of_lists`.
    Each Series contains unique integers starting from 1 and going up to the length of the respective sub-list. These integers
    are shuffled randomly to create a unique ordering for each Series.

    Parameters:
    - list_of_lists (list of list): This parameter is expected to be a list where each element is itself a list.
      These inner lists are used as indices for the Series objects. Each inner list represents the index of one Series.

    Returns:
    - series_list (list of pandas.Series): This function returns a list. Each element in this list is a pandas Series object.
      The Series objects are indexed by the elements of the sub-lists provided in `list_of_lists`. The values in each Series
      are unique integers that are randomly shuffled.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - numpy

    Example:
    - Here's an example demonstrating how to use this function:
      >>> import numpy as np
      >>> np.random.seed(0)  # Setting a seed for reproducibility of the example
      >>> series = task_func([['x', 'y', 'z'], ['a', 'b', 'c']])
      >>> for s in series: print(s)
      x    3
      y    2
      z    1
      dtype: int64
      a    3
      b    1
      c    2
      dtype: int64

    Note:
    - The function uses numpy's random shuffle, which modifies the sequence in-place. Therefore, each call to the function
      may produce different Series values unless the random seed is set beforehand.
