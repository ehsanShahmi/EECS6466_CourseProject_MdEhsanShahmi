def task_func(num_strings, string_length):
    """
    Creates a list of random strings, each of a specified length, and counts the frequency
    of each character across all strings. The function then returns the characters
    and their frequencies sorted by frequency in descending order.
    The random strings are composed of ASCII lowercase characters.

    Parameters:
        num_strings (int): The number of random strings to generate.
        string_length (int): The length of each random string.

    Requirements:
    - random
    - string
    - collections.Counter

    Returns:
        list of tuple: A list of tuples where each tuple contains a character and its count,
                       sorted by count in descending order.

    Examples:
    >>> type(task_func(1000, 5)) == list
    True
    >>> all(isinstance(pair, tuple) and len(pair) == 2 for pair in task_func(1000, 5))
    True
