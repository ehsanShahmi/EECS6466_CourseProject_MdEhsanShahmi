def task_func():
    """
    Generate a random poker hand consisting of five cards, and count the frequency of each card rank.

    The function creates a list of five cards where each card is a string made up of a rank and a suit (e.g., "10H" for Ten of Hearts).
    It then counts the frequency of each card rank in the hand using a Counter dictionary.

    Parameters:
    - None

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing two elements:
        - hand (list): A list of five cards.
        - rank_count (counter): A Counter dictionary of card ranks with their frequencies in the hand.

    Requirements:
    - collections
    - random

    Example:
        >>> random.seed(42)
        >>> hand, rank_counts = task_func()
        >>> print(hand)  
        ['QH', '2C', '5D', '4H', 'QH']
        >>> print(rank_counts)  
        Counter({'Q': 2, '2': 1, '5': 1, '4': 1})
