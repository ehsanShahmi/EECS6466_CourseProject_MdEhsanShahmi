def task_func(directory, string):
    """
    Search for a specific string within the JSON data of files in a given directory and its subdirectories.

    This function recursively scans the specified directory for JSON files, then checks each file to see if 
    the given string is present within the JSON data structure.

    Parameters:
    directory (str): The directory path where the search should be performed.
    string (str): The string to search for within the JSON data of the files.

    Returns:
    list: A list of file paths (str) containing the string within their JSON data.

    Requirements:
    - json
    - pathlib
    - glob

    Note:
    - The string search is case-sensitive and looks for a match within the structure of the JSON data, not 
    just as a substring in the file content.
    - If the directory does not contain any JSON files or if no JSON files contain the string, an empty list 
    is returned.

    Example:
    >>> import tempfile
    >>> import json
    >>> directory = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    >>> with open(directory + "/file1.json", "w") as file:
    ...     json.dump({"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}, file)
    >>> with open(directory + "/file2.json", "w") as file:
    ...     json.dump({"book": "Harry Potter", "author": "J.K. Rowling", "quote": "Magic is everywhere!"}, file)
    >>> files = task_func(directory, "book")
    >>> len(files)
    1
