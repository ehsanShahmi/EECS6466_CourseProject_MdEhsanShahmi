def task_func(arr):
    """
    Plots a heatmap of a given 2D numerical array and prints the sum of each row.
    The heatmap's color range is set based on the minimum and maximum values in the array.

    Parameters:
    arr (numpy.array): A 2D numpy array of numerical values.

    Returns:
    ax (matplotlib.axes.Axes): The Axes object with the plotted heatmap.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - seaborn

    Note:
    The function calculates the sum of each row and prints these values.
    The heatmap is plotted based on the original array with its color range set from the minimum to the maximum value in the array.

    Example:
    >>> arr = np.array([[i + j for i in range(3)] for j in range(5)])
    >>> ax = task_func(arr)
    >>> ax.get_title()
    'Heatmap of the 2D Array'
