    """
    Processes a CSV file at the given path by reading its contents, cleaning the data,
    performing statistical analysis, and generating a plot, which is saved to the specified path.

    Sets the title of the plot to "Data Visualization".

        - Median (float): The middle value of the data when sorted. Returns NaN if data is empty or non-numeric.
        - Plot Path (str): The path where the plot is saved.

    Raises:
    - FileNotFoundError: If the CSV file at 'file_path' does not exist.

    - matplotlib
    - numpy
