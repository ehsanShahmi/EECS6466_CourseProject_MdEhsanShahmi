def task_func(csv_file_path: str):
    """
    This function reads data from a CSV file, normalizes a specific column named 'column1', and then plots the normalized data.

    - The title is created using Python's string formatting, aligning 'Plot Title' and 'Normalized Column 1' on either side of a 
    colon, each padded to 20 characters.
    - Similarly, the x-label is formatted with 'Index' and 'Normalized Value' on either side of a colon, 
    each padded to 20 characters.
    - The y-label is set in the same manner, with 'Frequency' and 'Normalized Value' on either side of a colon.

    Parameters:
    - csv_file_path (str): Path to the CSV file. The file must contain a column named 'column1'.

    Returns:
    - The matplotlib.axes.Axes object with the plot of the normalized data.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib

    Example:
    >>> ax = task_func('data.csv')
    >>> ax.get_title()
    "          Plot Title :  Normalized Column 1"
