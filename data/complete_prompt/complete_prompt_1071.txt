def task_func(list_of_lists):
    """
    Plots a series of lines for each list in `list_of_lists`. Each line is plotted with shuffled y-values
    and sequential x-values starting from 1. The function shuffles the y-values of each inner list before plotting.
    Each line is plotted with a different color from a predetermined set of colors. The function cycles through 
    these colors for each inner list.

    Parameters:
    - list_of_lists (list of list): A list of lists where each inner
    list represents a set of y-values to be shuffled and plotted. The x-values are automatically
    generated as a sequence starting from 1 up to the length of the inner list.

    Returns:
    - tuple: A tuple containing the figure and axes objects of the plotted graph.

    Requirements:
    - matplotlib
    - itertools
    - numpy
    - random

    Example:
    >>> import random
    >>> random.seed(0)
    >>> fig, ax = task_func([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> ax.lines[0].get_color()
    (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1)

    Note:
    - If an inner list is empty, it will be skipped and no line will be plotted for it.
    - The colors are reused cyclically if there are more inner lists than colors available.
    - The shuffling of y-values is random and different each time the function is called,
      unless a random seed is set externally.
    - The function uses a default set of colors defined in the COLORS constant.
