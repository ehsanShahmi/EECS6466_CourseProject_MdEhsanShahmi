def task_func(script_path, output_file_path):
    """
    Executes a script to produce a CSV, reads the CSV, and plots a bar graph from the data.

    This function runs the provided script, which should generate a CSV file at the specified output path.
    The CSV must have exactly two columns. It then reads this CSV into a DataFrame and plots a bar graph,
    setting the first column as the x-axis labels and the second column as the bar heights.
    It will raise ValueError if the script fails to execute, or if the produced CSV is not valid.

    Parameters:
    - script_path (str): Path to the script to be executed.
    - output_file_path (str): Path where the script outputs the CSV.

    Returns:
    - df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing the data from the CSV.
    - ax (matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes): Axes object of the plotted bar graph.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If the script fails to execute, the CSV is invalid, or the CSV does not contain exactly 2 columns.
    
    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - subprocess

    Examples:
    >>> df, ax = task_func("generate_data.sh", "data.csv")
    >>> type(df)
    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    >>> type(ax)
    <class 'matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes'>
