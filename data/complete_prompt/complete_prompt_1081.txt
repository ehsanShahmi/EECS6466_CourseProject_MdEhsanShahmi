def task_func(data=None):
    """
    Converts string-formatted weights to floats and plots a scatter plot of weight against height.

    This function takes a dictionary with two keys: 'Weight_String' and 'Height'. The 'Weight_String' key should 
    contain a list of weight values in string format, while the 'Height' key should have a list of corresponding 
    height values in numerical format. If the input dictionary is not provided, the function uses a default dataset.
    The function then converts the string-formatted weights into float, and plots a scatter plot to visualize 
    the relationship between weight and height.
       
    Parameters:
    - data (dict, optional): A dictionary with keys 'Weight_String' and 'Height'. 'Weight_String' is expected to be 
                           a list of weight values in string format (e.g., ['60.5', '65.7']), and 'Height' is expected 
                           to be a list of corresponding numerical height values (e.g., [160, 165]). If no dictionary 
                           is provided, a default dataset with predetermined values is used.
                           Default dictionary:
                           {
                               'Weight_String': ['60.5', '65.7', '70.2', '75.9', '80.1'],
                               'Height': [160, 165, 170, 175, 180]
                           }

    Returns:
    - ax (matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes): A scatter plot with weight on the x-axis and height on the y-axis, titled "Weight vs Height".

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If any of the values in the 'Weight_String' key are not formatted as strings. This validation ensures 
                that the weight data is in the expected format for conversion to float.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - seaborn

    Example:
    >>> ax = task_func()
    >>> print(ax.get_title())
    Weight vs Height
