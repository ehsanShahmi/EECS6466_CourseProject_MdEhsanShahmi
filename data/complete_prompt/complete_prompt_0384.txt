def task_func(animal_dict, max_count=10, seed=0):
    """
    Given a constant list of animals in ANIMALS, and a dictionary 'animal_dict' with keys as people's names and values
    as their favorite animal names, reverse the keys and values in a given dictionary and count the occurrences of each
    predefined animal name with a random count. Return the reversed dictionary and the counter with animal name
    occurrences.

    This function performs two tasks:
    1. It reverses the given dictionary (animal_dict) such that the original values become keys and the original 
    keys become lists of values.
    2. It counts the occurrences of each animal name in a predefined list (ANIMALS). The count of each animal name
    is a random integer between 1 and max_count (inclusive).

    Parameters:
    animal_dict (dict): A dictionary with keys as names and values as animal names.
    max_count (int, Optional): A positive integer denoting the maximum count of each animal. Default is 10.
    Must be greater than 0.
    seed (int, Optional): An integer to seed the random number generator. Default is 0.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple where the first element is a reversed dictionary and the second element is a counter with animal 
           name occurrences (with randomness in count).

    Requirements:
    - collections
    - random
    - itertools

    Example:
    >>> animal_dict = {'John': 'Cat', 'Alice': 'Dog', 'Bob': 'Elephant', 'Charlie': 'Lion', 'David': 'Tiger', 'Sue': 'Pangolin'}
    >>> reversed_dict, animal_counter = task_func(animal_dict, 15, 77)
    >>> reversed_dict
    {'Cat': ['John'], 'Dog': ['Alice'], 'Elephant': ['Bob'], 'Lion': ['Charlie'], 'Tiger': ['David']}
    >>> dict(animal_counter.most_common(5))
    {'Giraffe': 14, 'Cat': 13, 'Zebra': 9, 'Snake': 8, 'Elephant': 6}
