def task_func(matrix):
    """
    Sorts a numeric 2D numpy array in ascending order and finds all unique combinations of two elements from the sorted array.
    
    Parameters:
    - matrix (numpy.array): A 2D numpy array of any shape (m, n), where m and n are non-negative integers.
    
    Returns:
    - tuple: A tuple containing two elements:
        1. numpy.array: A 1D array with all elements of the input array sorted in ascending order.
        2. list: A list of tuples, each containing a pair of elements from the sorted array, representing all unique combinations taken two at a time.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - itertools
    
    Example:
    >>> task_func(np.array([[1, 3], [2, 4]]))
    (array([1, 2, 3, 4]), [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)])
