def task_func(goals, penalties, rng_seed=None, teams=TEAMS):
    """
    Generate and analyze a Pandas DataFrame of football match results for multiple teams,
    incorporating random goals and penalties, then visualize the analyzed data with colomns 'Team', 'Goals',
    and 'Penalty Cost'. Penalties are converted into fines based on a predetermined penalty cost.

    Parameters:
    - goals (int): The maximum number of goals a team can score in a match.
    - penalties (int): The maximum number of penalties a team can receive in a match.
    - rng_seed (int, optional): Seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility. Defaults to None.
    - teams (list of str, optional): List of team names to assign players

    Returns:
    - DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame containing teams, their goals, and penalty costs, along with the original match results.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib.pyplot
    - random
    - re

    Example:
    >>> analyzed_data = task_func(5, 3, rng_seed=42)
    >>> print(analyzed_data[['Team', 'Goals', 'Penalty Cost']])
         Team  Goals  Penalty Cost
    0  Team A      5             0
    1  Team B      0          2000
    2  Team C      1          1000
    3  Team D      1             0
    4  Team E      5             0
