def task_func(n, seed=None):
    """
    Generate a number of random lowercase letters and count their occurrences.

    This function takes an integer input to determine how many random letters 
    to generate and an optional seed for consistent randomness. It then creates 
    a list of these letters, chosen from the English lowercase alphabet, and 
    counts each letter's occurrences. The result is returned as a Counter 
    object (from the collections module) which behaves like a dictionary where 
    the keys are the letters, and the values are their counts.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of random letters to generate.
    seed (int, optional): A seed for the random number generator for consistent
                         results. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
    Counter: A collections.Counter object with the count of each letter.

    Requirements:
    - collections
    - string
    - random

    Example:
    >>> letter_counts = task_func(1000, seed=123)
    >>> print(letter_counts)
    Counter({'v': 48, 'b': 47, 'n': 46, 'r': 46, 'k': 46, 'z': 46, 'c': 44, 'e': 43, 'q': 43, 'l': 43, 'y': 42, 'm': 42, 'a': 42, 'u': 42, 'd': 36, 'o': 34, 'j': 34, 'g': 34, 'f': 33, 'h': 33, 'p': 32, 'w': 30, 'x': 30, 'i': 29, 't': 28, 's': 27})
    >>> task_func(10, seed=12)
    Counter({'v': 2, 'l': 2, 'p': 1, 'i': 1, 'q': 1, 'e': 1, 'm': 1, 'a': 1})

    Note: 
    The function internally uses a list to store the randomly generated 
    letters before counting them. The randomness of letter selection can be 
    consistent by providing a seed.
