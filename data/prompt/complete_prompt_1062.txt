    """
    Calculate the sum of each row in a 2D numpy array and plot these sums as a time series.

    This function takes a 2D numpy array and computes the sum of elements in each row. It
    then creates a Pandas DataFrame with these row sums and plots them as a time series,
    using dates starting from January 1, 2020, for each row.

    Parameters:
    arr (numpy.ndarray): A 2D numpy array.

    Returns:
    matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes: A plot representing the time series of row sums.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib

    Handling Scenarios:
    - For non-empty arrays: The function computes the sum of elements for each row, 
    stores these sums in a Pandas DataFrame, and then plots them. Each row in the plot represents 
    the sum for a specific day, starting from January 1, 2020.
    - For empty arrays: The function creates an empty plot with the 
    title 'Time Series of Row Sums' but without data. This is achieved by checking if the array size 
    is zero (empty array) and if so, creating a subplot without any data.
    
    Note: 
    - The function uses 'pandas' for DataFrame creation and 'matplotlib.pyplot' for plotting. 
    The dates in the plot start from January 1, 2020, and each subsequent row represents the next day.
    
    Example:
    >>> arr = np.array([[i + j for i in range(3)] for j in range(5)])
    >>> ax = task_func(arr)
    >>> ax.get_title()
    'Time Series of Row Sums'
