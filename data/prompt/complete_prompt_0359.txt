def task_func(data_dict, data_keys):
    """
    Calculate the correlation between two data series and return a scatter plot along with the correlation coefficient.
    
    Parameters:
    data_dict (dict): The dictionary containing data. Keys should match those provided in data_keys.
    data_keys (list): The list of keys (length of 2) used to access data in data_dict for correlation.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: 
        - float: The correlation coefficient.
        - Axes: The scatter plot of the two data series.
    
    Requirements:
    - scipy
    - matplotlib.pyplot
    
    Example:
    >>> data_dict = {'X': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'Y': [2, 3, 5, 7, 8]}
    >>> data_keys = ['X', 'Y']
    >>> correlation, plot = task_func(data_dict, data_keys)
    >>> round(correlation, 4)
    0.9923
    >>> isinstance(plot, plt.Axes)
    True
