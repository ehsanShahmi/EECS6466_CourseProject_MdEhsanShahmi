def task_func(path, delimiter):
    """
    Splits a file path by a specified delimiter, retaining the delimiter in the output, and computes the hash of each component if it is a file.
    
    Parameters:
    path (str): The file path to split.
    delimiter (str): The delimiter to use for splitting the path.

    Returns:
    list[tuple]: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a path component and its hash (if it's a file).
                 If the component is not a file, its hash will be None.

    Requirements:

    - re
    - hashlib

    Example:
    >>> task_func("Docs/src/file.txt", "/")
    [('Docs', None), ('/', None), ('src', None), ('/', None), ('file.txt', 'hash_value')]
