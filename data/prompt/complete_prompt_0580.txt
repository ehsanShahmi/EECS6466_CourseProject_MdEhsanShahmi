def task_func():
    """
    Generates a pandas DataFrame with two columns, "Random Numbers" and "Moving Average,"
    filled with random integers and their moving average, respectively.
    Additionally, this function plots a histogram of the "Random Numbers" column.

    No Parameters.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with two columns:
                      - "Random Numbers": Contains a list of randomly generated integers.
                      - "Moving Average": Contains the moving average of the random integers,
                                          calculated over a window that includes the current
                                          and previous 5 integers.

    Requirements:
        - pandas
        - random
        - statistics
        - matplotlib.pyplot
        - numpy

    Example:
        >>> df = task_func()
        >>> isinstance(df, pd.DataFrame)
        True
        >>> 'Random Numbers' in df.columns and 'Moving Average' in df.columns
        True
        >>> len(df)
        1000
        >>> all(df['Random Numbers'].between(0, RANGE))
        True
