def task_func(LETTERS):
    """
    Create a dictionary where keys are specified letters and values are lists of random integers.
    Then calculate the mean of these integers for each key and return a dictionary of these means.

    Parameters:
        LETTERS (list of str): List of single-character strings to be used as keys in the output dictionary.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where each key is a letter from the input list and the value is the mean of 
              a randomly generated list of integers (with each list having 1 to 10 integers ranging from 0 to 100).
    
    Requirements:
    - random
    - np (numpy)
    
    Example:
    >>> LETTERS = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    >>> mean_dict = task_func(LETTERS)
    >>> isinstance(mean_dict, dict)
    True
    >>> 'a' in mean_dict.keys() and 'b' in mean_dict.keys() and 'c' in mean_dict.keys()
    True
    >>> all(isinstance(v, float) for v in mean_dict.values())  # Check if all values are floats
    True
