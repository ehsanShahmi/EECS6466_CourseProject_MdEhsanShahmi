def task_func(l):
    """
    Create a deque from a list, rotate it to the right by 3 positions, and return the deque.
    Also, for demonstration, calculates the square root of the sum of numeric elements in the deque,
    if there are any, and prints it.

    Parameters:
    - l (list): A list of elements to be converted into a deque and rotated.

    Returns:
    - dq (collections.deque): A deque obtained from the input list after performing a right rotation by 3 positions.

    Requirements:
    - collections
    - math

    Example:
    >>> task_func(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'])
    deque(['C', 'D', 'E', 'A', 'B'])

    >>> task_func([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    The square root of the sum of numeric elements: 3.872983346207417
    deque([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])
