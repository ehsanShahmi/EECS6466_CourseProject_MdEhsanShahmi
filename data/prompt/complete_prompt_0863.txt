    Calculate the sum of the squares of numbers from a predefined range (POSSIBLE_NUMBERS) 
    for each list in list_of_lists. The number of elements considered from POSSIBLE_NUMBERS 
    is determined by the length of each list.

    Parameters:
    - list_of_lists (list): A list of lists, each representing a set of numbers.

    Returns:
    - sums (list): A list of sums of squares.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - math

    Example:
    >>> sums = task_func([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]])
    >>> print(sums)
    [14.0, 5.0]
