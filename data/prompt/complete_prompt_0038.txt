def task_func(data_matrix):
    """
    Standardize a 2D data matrix, calculate the mean value of each row and then visualize the distribution of the mean values with an histogram.
    - Each row of the matrix represent a data point, its length is the same as that of FEATURE_NAMES.
    - The plot title should be 'Distribution of Means'.

    Parameters:
    data_matrix (numpy.array): The 2D data matrix.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - pandas.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the standardized data and the mean of each row.
                            Its column names should be FEATURE_NAMES and 'Mean'.
        - matplotlib.axes.Axes: The histogram plot of the distribution of means.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler
    - matplotlib.pyplot

    Example:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> data = np.array([[6, 8, 1, 3, 4], [-1, 0, 3, 5, 1]])
    >>> df, ax = task_func(data)
    >>> print(df)
       Feature 1  Feature 2  Feature 3  Feature 4  Feature 5  Mean
    0        1.0        1.0       -1.0       -1.0        1.0   0.2
    1       -1.0       -1.0        1.0        1.0       -1.0  -0.2
