def task_func(animals, mean):
    """
    Simulates sales in a pet shop based on a randomly determined number of customers.
    Each customer randomly buys one type of animal from the specified list of animals.
    The function displays and returns a summary of the sales, where the number of customers 
    follows a Poisson distribution with the specified mean (mu).

    Parameters:
        animals (list of str): A list of animal types available for sale.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with animal types as keys and the number of sales as values.

    Requirements:
    - random
    - scipy.stats

    Examples:
    >>> ANIMALS = ['Dog', 'Cat', 'Bird', 'Fish', 'Hamster']
    >>> sales = task_func(ANIMALS, 120)
    >>> isinstance(sales, dict)
    True
    >>> all(animal in ANIMALS for animal in sales.keys())
    True
    >>> sum(sales.values()) >= 0  # sum of sales should be non-negative
    True
