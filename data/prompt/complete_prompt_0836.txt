def task_func(target_value='332', csv_dir='./csv_files/', processed_dir='./processed_files/', simulate=False):
    """
    Scans a directory for CSV files, finds for each file the index of the row with the first cell equal to the target value,
    and optionally moves the processed files to another directory.
    
    Parameters:
    - target_value (str): The value to search for in the first cell of each row. Defaults to '332'.
    - csv_dir (str): The directory to scan for CSV files. Defaults to './csv_files/'.
    - processed_dir (str): The directory to move processed files to. Defaults to './processed_files/'.
    - simulate (bool): If True, the function will simulate file moving without performing the action. Defaults to False.
    
    Returns:
    - result (dict): A dictionary with file names as keys and the row indices as values where the target value was found.
    
    Requirements:
    - os
    - shutil
    - csv
    
    Example:
    >>> task_func(target_value='332', csv_dir='./csv_files/', processed_dir='./processed_files/', simulate=True)
    {'file1.csv': 10, 'file2.csv': 15}
    
    The above example assumes that '332' is found at index 10 in 'file1.csv' and index 15 in 'file2.csv' and that the 
    file moving is simulated.
