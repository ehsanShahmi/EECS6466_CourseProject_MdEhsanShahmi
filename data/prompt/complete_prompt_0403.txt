def task_func(img_path, blur_radius=5):
    """
    Open an RGB image from a specific path, apply a blur filter, convert it to grayscale, and then display both the original and the edited images side by side.
    Returns numpy arrays representing both the original and the processed images.

    Parameters:
    - img_path (str): The path of the image file.
    - blur_radius (int): The radius of the Gaussian blur filter. Default is 5.

    Returns:
    - tuple: A tuple containing two numpy arrays, the first representing the original image and 
             the second representing the blurred and grayscaled image.

    Raises:
    - FileNotFoundError: If the image file does not exist at the specified path.

    Requirements:
    - PIL
    - opencv-python
    - numpy
    - os

    Example:
    >>> image_path = 'sample.png'
    >>> create_dummy_image(image_path=image_path)
    >>> original, processed = task_func(image_path)
    >>> os.remove(image_path)
