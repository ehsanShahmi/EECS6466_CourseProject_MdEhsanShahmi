def task_func():
    """
    Generates a set of 2D random points within a specified range and size,
    applies KMeans clustering to these points, and plots the results with
    cluster centroids.

    The function creates a scatter plot of the clustered points with each
    cluster displayed in a different color and the centroids of these clusters
    highlighted.

    Requirements:
        - numpy
        - sklearn.cluster
        - matplotlib.pyplot

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the numpy array of data points and the fitted KMeans model.

    Example:
    >>> data, kmeans = task_func()
    >>> isinstance(data, np.ndarray)  # Check if data is a numpy array
    True
    >>> data.shape == (1000, 2)  # Verify the shape of the data array
    True
    >>> isinstance(kmeans, KMeans)  # Confirm kmeans is an instance of KMeans
    True
    >>> len(kmeans.cluster_centers_) == 5  # Check the number of clusters
    True
