    """
    Draws the linear equation y = 2x + 1 on a 2D plot for x values ranging from -10 to 10, and marks the solution for x = 2 with a green 'o' (circle) marker.

    The plot includes:
    - A red line representing the equation y = 2x + 1, labeled as 'y=2x+1', for x in [-10, 10].
    - A green circle marker indicating the solution at x = 2, y = 5.
    - Title: 'Solution of the equation y=2x+1 at x=2'
    - X-axis labeled as 'x', with a range from -10 to 10.
    - Y-axis labeled as 'y', with a range automatically adjusted based on the equation.
    - A legend indicating labels for the equation and the solution point.

    Returns:
        matplotlib.axes.Axes: An object representing the plot with specified features and ranges.

    Requirements:
        - numpy
        - matplotlib.pyplot
    
    Example:
    >>> ax = task_func()
    >>> ax.get_title()
    'Solution of the equation y=2x+1 at x=2'
