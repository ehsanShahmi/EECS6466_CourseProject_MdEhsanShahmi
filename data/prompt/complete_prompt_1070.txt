def task_func(list_of_lists):
    """
    Generate a list of pandas DataFrames, each created from a sublist in 'list_of_lists'.
    Each DataFrame has columns named as per the elements of the sublist, and each column
    is filled with randomly shuffled values from 'POSSIBLE_VALUES'.

    Parameters:
    - list_of_lists (list of list): A list where each element is a list of strings
    representing column names for a DataFrame.

    Returns:
    - list of pandas.DataFrame: A list where each element is a DataFrame with columns as specified
    in 'list_of_lists', and each column contains shuffled values from 'POSSIBLE_VALUES'.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - random.shuffle

    Note:
    - The length of each DataFrame's columns is equal to the length of 'POSSIBLE_VALUES'.
    - Each column in the DataFrame has the same shuffled order of 'POSSIBLE_VALUES'.

    Example:
    >>> import random
    >>> random.seed(0)
    >>> dfs = task_func([['x', 'y', 'z'], ['a', 'b', 'c']])
    >>> dfs[0].head()
       x  y  z
    0  H  J  H
    1  I  E  A
    2  B  I  J
    3  F  G  D
    4  D  A  C
