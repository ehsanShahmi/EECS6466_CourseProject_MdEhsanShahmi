def task_func(numbers):
    """
    Generates all possible combinations of the provided numbers in a given list for
    each possible length. For each combination, it computes the product of the numbers
    in the combination. It then computes the logarithm of each product and sums these
    logarithms to produce the final result.

    Parameters:
        numbers (list of int): A list of integers for which combinations are formed.

    Requirements:
    - math
    - itertools
    - functools

    Returns:
        float: The sum of the logarithms of the products of all combinations of numbers.

    Examples:
    >>> numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
    >>> type(task_func(numbers)) == float
    True
    >>> isinstance(task_func(numbers), float)
    True
