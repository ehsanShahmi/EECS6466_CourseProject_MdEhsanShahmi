def task_func(file_pointer):
    """
    Reads from a given file pointer to a JSON file, evaluates strings that represent dictionaries to actual dictionaries,
    and counts the frequency of each key across all dictionary entries in the JSON data.

    
    Parameters:
    file_pointer (file object): An open file object pointing to the JSON file containing the data. This file should
                                already be opened in the correct mode (e.g., 'r' for reading).

    Returns:
    collections.Counter: A Counter object representing the frequency of each key found in the dictionaries.

    Requirements:
    - ast
    - json
    - collections.Counter
    
    Note:
    This function assumes the input JSON data is a list of dictionaries or strings that can be evaluated as dictionaries.
    
    Example:
    >>> with open("data.json", "r") as file:
    >>>    key_frequency = task_func(file)
    >>>    print(key_frequency)
    Counter({'name': 5, 'age': 5, 'city': 3})
