def task_func(numbers):
    """
    Creates and returns a dictionary with the mode and entropy of a numpy array constructed from a given list.
    The function first converts the list into a numpy array, then calculates the mode and the entropy (base 2) of this array,
    and finally adds them to the initial dictionary with the keys 'mode' and 'entropy'.

    Parameters:
        numbers (list): A non-empty list of numbers from which a numpy array is created to calculate mode and entropy.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the 'mode' and 'entropy' of the array with their respective calculated values.

    Raises:
        ValueError if the input list `numbers` is empty

    Requirements:
        - numpy
        - scipy.stats.mode
        - scipy.stats.entropy

    Examples:
        >>> result = task_func([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])
        >>> 'mode' in result and result['mode'] == 3 and 'entropy' in result
        True
