def task_func(goals, penalties, rng_seed=None):
    """
    Simulates football match results with random goals and penalties for multiple teams,
    and trains a linear regression model to predict penalty costs from goals.

    Parameters:
    - goals (int): Maximum number of goals a team can score in a match.
    - penalties (int): Maximum number of penalties a team can receive in a match.
    - rng_seed (int, optional): Seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
    - tuple:
        - pd.DataFrame: Contains 'Team', 'Goals', and 'Penalty Cost' columns.
        - LinearRegression: Trained model to predict 'Penalty Cost' based on 'Goals'.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - sklearn.linear_model
    - random

    Example:
    >>> df, model = task_func(5, 3, rng_seed=42)
    >>> predictions = model.predict([[2], [3]])
    >>> print(predictions)
    [706.89655172 439.65517241]
