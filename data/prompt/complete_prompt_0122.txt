def task_func(my_list):
    """
    Appends a randomly selected integer between 0 and 100 to the given list 'my_list' and 
    returns a numpy array of random floating-point numbers. The size of the returned array 
    is equal to the sum of the numbers in the modified list.

    Parameters:
        my_list (list): A list of integers to which a random number will be added.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: An array of random floating-point numbers. The length of the array 
                       is equal to the sum of the integers in 'my_list' after a random 
                       number has been appended.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - random
                       
    Examples:
        >>> result = task_func([2, 3, 5])
        >>> 10 <= len(result) <= 110  # Expecting the length to be within the range after adding a random number between 0 and 100
        True
        >>> isinstance(result, np.ndarray)
        True
