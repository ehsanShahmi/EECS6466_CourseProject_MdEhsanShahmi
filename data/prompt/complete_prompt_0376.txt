def task_func(text):
    """
    Calculate the frequency of continuous words in a text string. The function splits the text into words, 
    converts them to lowercase, removes punctuation marks and common stopwords (provided as a constant), 
    and then calculates the frequency of each word.

    Parameters:
    text (str): The input text string.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary with words as keys and their frequencies as values.

    Requirements:
    - nltk for stopwords (ensure the stopwords dataset is downloaded using nltk.download('stopwords'))
    - re for regular expressions
    - collections.Counter for counting occurrences

    Example:
    >>> task_func('This is a sample text. This text is for testing.')
    {'sample': 1, 'text': 2, 'testing': 1}
