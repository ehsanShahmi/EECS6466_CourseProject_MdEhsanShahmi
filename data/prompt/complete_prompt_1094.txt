def task_func(text):
    """
    Identifies and counts words in a given text that start with the "$" symbol. It returns the five most frequent
    dollar-prefixed words along with their counts. Words solely consisting of "$" symbols without any following
    alphanumeric characters are ignored in the frequency count.

    Parameters:
    - text (str): The input text to analyze.

    Returns:
    - list of tuples: Each tuple contains a dollar-prefixed word (excluding the "$" symbol) and its frequency,
                      ordered by most to least common.

    Requirements:
    - nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer
    - collections.Counter

    Example:
    >>> text = "$abc def $efg $hij klm $ $abc $abc $hij $hij"
    >>> task_func(text)
    [('abc', 3), ('hij', 3), ('efg', 1)]
