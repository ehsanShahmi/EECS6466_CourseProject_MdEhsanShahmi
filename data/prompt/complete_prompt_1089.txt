def task_func(list_of_tuples):
    """
    Computes the sum of numeric values and counts the occurrences of categories in a list of tuples.

    Each tuple in the input list contains a numeric value and a category. This function calculates
    the sum of all the numeric values and also counts how many times each category appears in the list.

    Parameters:
    - list_of_tuples (list of tuple): A list where each tuple contains a numeric value and a category.

    Returns:
    - tuple: A 2-element tuple where the first element is the sum of the numeric values, and the
             second element is a dictionary with categories as keys and their counts as values.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - collections.Counter

    Example:
    >>> list_of_tuples = [(5, 'Fruits'), (9, 'Vegetables'), (-1, 'Dairy'), (-2, 'Bakery'), (4, 'Meat')]
    >>> sum_of_values, category_counts = task_func(list_of_tuples)
    >>> print(sum_of_values)
    15
    >>> print(category_counts)
    {'Fruits': 1, 'Vegetables': 1, 'Dairy': 1, 'Bakery': 1, 'Meat': 1}
