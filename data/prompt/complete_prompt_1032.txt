def task_func(rows=1000, string_length=3):
    """
    Generate a dataframe of random strings and create a heatmap showing the correlation
    in the frequency of each letter in these strings.

    This function generates a specified number of random strings, each of a given length,
    and calculates the frequency of each letter in these strings. A heatmap of the 
    correlation matrix is then displayed, showing the co-occurrence frequencies of different 
    letters within these strings.

    If the number of rows specified is zero, the function will print a message indicating
    that no data is available to generate the heatmap and will return None. Otherwise, 
    it processes the DataFrame to convert the generated strings into a one-hot encoded format
    and then sums up these encodings to calculate the frequency of each letter.

    Parameters:
    - rows (int, optional): Number of random strings to generate. Must be non-negative. 
      Default is 1000. If set to 0, the function returns None after printing a message.
    - string_length (int, optional): Length of each random string. Must be non-negative. 
      Default is 3. A value of 0 results in the generation of empty strings.

    Returns:
    - matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes or None: A seaborn heatmap plot object if 
      data is generated; otherwise, None.

    Requirements:
    - random
    - string
    - pandas
    - seaborn
    - matplotlib

    Note
    - If no strings are generated (e.g., rows = 0), the 
       DataFrame will be empty. In this case, the function prints a message "No data to generate heatmap." and returns None.
    - If the DataFrame is not empty, each string is split into its 
       constituent letters, converted into one-hot encoded format, and then the frequency 
       of each letter is calculated by summing these encodings.
       
    Example:
    >>> ax = task_func(1000, 3)
    >>> ax.get_xlim()
    (0.0, 26.0)
