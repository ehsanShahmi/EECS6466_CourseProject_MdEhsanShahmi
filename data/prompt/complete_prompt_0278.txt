def task_func(precision=2, seed=0):
    """
    Solve a quadratic equation in the form of ax ^ 2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c randomly generated numbers are between -10 and 10. The solutions are complex numbers rounded to the specified accuracy.

    Parameters:
    precision (int): The number of decimal places to which to round the solutions.
    seed (int, Optional): The seed for the random number generator.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple of two solutions formatted as complex numbers (rounded to the specified precision).

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - math
    - sympy

    Example:
    >>> result = task_func()
    >>> len(result)
    2
    >>> result
    ((-3.86+0j), (-0.54+0j))
