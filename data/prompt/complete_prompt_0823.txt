def task_func(samples=10, delay=0.1):
    """
    Make a delay for a given amount of time for a specified number of samples,
    measure the actual delay and calculate the statistical properties of the
    delay times.

    Parameters:
    - samples (int): Number of samples for which the delay is measured.
                     Default is 10.
    - delay (float): Amount of time (in seconds) for each delay.
                     Default is 0.1 second.

    Returns:
    tuple: The mean and standard deviation of the delay times.

    Requirements:
    - time
    - numpy

    Example:
    >>> mean, std = task_func(samples=5, delay=0.05)
    >>> print(f'Mean: %.3f, Std: %.1f' % (mean, std))
    Mean: 0.050, Std: 0.0
    >>> mean, std = task_func(100, 0.001)
    >>> print(f'Mean: %.3f, Std: %.4f' % (mean, std))
    Mean: 0.001, Std: 0.0000
