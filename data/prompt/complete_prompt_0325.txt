def task_func(directory_path: str, regex_pattern: str = r'\\(.+?\\)|\\w') -> dict:
    """
    Extracts matches from all text files in a specified directory based on a regular expression pattern. 
    It captures whatever is between parentheses as a single match, and any character outside the parentheses 
    as individual matches in the string.

    Parameters:
    - directory_path (str): The path to the directory containing the text files.
    - regex_pattern (str): The regular expression pattern to use for matching. Defaults to REGEX_PATTERN.

    Returns:
    - dict: A dictionary where keys are file names (without path) and values are lists of matches extracted from the files.

    Requirements:
    - Utilizes libraries: re, os, pathlib.Path, and glob.glob

    Example:
    >>> matches = task_func('/path/to/directory') # Test with fictional directory path
    >>> print(matches)
    {}
