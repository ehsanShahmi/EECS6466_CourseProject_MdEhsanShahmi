def task_func():
    """
    The function creates an HTTP POST request handler for processing incoming data. The data is expected to be in JSON format with a key 'data'. The handler responds with a 200 success message if the data is valid, or an error message otherwise.

    Notes:
    - If the 'Content-Type' header is not 'application/json', the server responds with a 400 Bad Request status and a JSON object:
      {"status": "error", "message": "Content-Type header is not application/json"}.
    - If the received JSON object does not contain a 'data' key, the response is a 400 Bad Request with a JSON object:
      {"status": "error", "message": "No data received"}.
    - For successfully processed requests, the server responds with a 200 OK status and a JSON object:
      {"status": "success", "message": "Data received successfully."}.

    Returns:
    class: A class that is a subclass of http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler, designed to handle HTTP POST requests.
