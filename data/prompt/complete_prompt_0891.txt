def task_func(csv_file_path, attribute, test_size=0.2, random_state=42):
    """
    Train a linear regression model on a dataset and predict the value of a particular attribute.
    This function reads a CSV file to create a pandas DataFrame, separates the data into 
    training and testing sets, and performs linear regression. It returns the predicted 
    values for the testing set as well as the trained model.

    Parameters:
    csv_file_path (str): The path to the CSV file containing the data set.
    attribute (str): The attribute to predict.
    test_size (float, optional): Proportion of the dataset to include in the test split. Default is 0.2.
    random_state (int, optional): Seed used by the random number generator. Default is 42.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - model (LinearRegression): The trained linear regression model.
        - predictions (ndarray): An array of predicted values for the test set.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - sklearn.linear_model
    - sklearn.model_selection

    Note: The function assumes that the CSV file is correctly formatted and that the specified attribute exists.

    Example:
    >>> model, predictions = task_func("/path/to/data.csv", "target")
    >>> print(predictions)
    [123.45, ..., 126.78]
