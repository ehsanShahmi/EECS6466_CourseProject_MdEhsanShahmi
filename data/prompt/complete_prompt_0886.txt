    """
    Analyze a dictionary of student data to return a dataframe sorted by name and age in ascending order, 
    the average score per student as a pandas Series, and the most common age as an integer.
    
    Parameters:
    data (dict): A dictionary containing student data with three keys:
        - 'Name': List of student names.
        - 'Age': List of student ages.
        - 'Score': List of student scores.

    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame, pd.Series, int or None: 
        - A dataframe sorted by 'Name' and 'Age' in ascending order.
        - A series representing average scores indexed by student names.
        - An integer representing the most common age or None if no data is available.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If the dictionary does not have the required keys.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - collections

    Example:
    >>> data = {
    ...     'Name': ['Tom', 'Nick', 'John', 'Tom', 'John', 'John', 'Nick', 'Tom', 'John', 'Tom'],
    ...     'Age': [20, 21, 19, 20, 19, 19, 21, 20, 19, 20],
    ...     'Score': [85, 79, 92, 88, 90, 92, 81, 86, 90, 85]
    ... }
    >>> df, avg_scores, common_age = task_func(data)
    >>> print(df)
