def task_func(s, min_length, max_length, letters):
    """
    Generates a random string of length between `min_length` and `max_length`, inclusive,
    using characters from `letters`, and evaluates its similarity to the provided string `s`.
    A similarity score of 0.5 or higher considered 'similar'.

    Parameters:
    s (str): The string to which the generated string's similarity is evaluated.
    min_length (int): The minimum length for the generated string.
    max_length (int): The maximum length for the generated string.
    letters (str): A string of characters from which the random string is generated.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the generated string and a boolean indicating whether it's
           considered similar to `s` based on the similarity threshold.
           
    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - random
    - difflib.SequenceMatcher

    Examples:
    >>> s = 'apple'
    >>> min_length = 5
    >>> max_length = 10
    >>> letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    >>> generated_s, is_similar = task_func(s, min_length, max_length, letters)
    >>> len(generated_s) >= min_length and len(generated_s) <= max_length
    True
    >>> isinstance(is_similar, bool)
    True
