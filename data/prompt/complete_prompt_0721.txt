def task_func(file_path):
    """
    This function reads the specified CSV file, counts the frequency of each word, and returns the most common word 
    along with its frequency.

    Parameters:
    - file_path (str): The path to the CSV file.

    Requirements:
    - os
    - csv
    - collections

    Returns:
    - tuple: The most common word and its frequency, or None if the file doesn't exist or is empty.

    Example:
    >>> # Assuming 'example.txt' contains multiple repetitions of the word 'example'
    >>> task_func('example.txt')  # doctest: +SKIP
    ('example', <some_positive_integer>)

    Note:
    - The function specifically reads from the given file path.
    - This example uses +SKIP because it relies on external file content.
