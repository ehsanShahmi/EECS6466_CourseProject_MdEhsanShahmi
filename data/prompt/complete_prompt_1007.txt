def task_func(url: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    This function fetches JSON data from a specified URL and converts it into a Pandas DataFrame.
    It expects the JSON to be in a format that is directly convertible to a DataFrame, typically
    a list of dictionaries. The function handles various scenarios including successful data
    retrieval and conversion, network issues, and invalid JSON format.

    Parameters:
    - url (str): The URL where the JSON file is located.

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame constructed from the JSON data fetched from the URL.

    Raises:
    - SystemError: If there is a network-related issue such as a connection error, timeout,
      or if the server responded with an unsuccessful status code (like 404 or 500). This is a
      re-raised exception from requests.RequestException to provide a more specific error message.
    - ValueError: If the fetched data is not in a valid JSON format that can be converted into
      a DataFrame. This could occur if the data structure does not match the expected format (e.g.,
      not a list of dictionaries).

    Requirements:
    - requests
    - pandas

    Example:
    >>> task_func('https://example.com/data.json')
    DataFrame:
       A  B

    Notes:
    - The function uses a timeout of 5 seconds for the network request to avoid hanging indefinitely.
    - It checks the HTTP response status and raises an HTTPError for unsuccessful status codes.
    - Directly converts the HTTP response to JSON and then to a DataFrame, without intermediate processing.
