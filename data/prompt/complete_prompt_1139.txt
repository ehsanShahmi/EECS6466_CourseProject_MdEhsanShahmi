def task_func(data):
    ''' 
    Train a simple linear regression model based on the given data and evaluate the model by calculating the mean square error. The data should be structured with 'Hours' as independent variables and 'Scores' as dependent variables.
    The function set the random set when dividing the train and test data to 42 and the test set size is 0.2

    Parameters:
    - data (dict): The dictionary with keys 'Hours' and 'Scores', representing study hours and respective scores.

    Returns:
    float: The mean squared error between the actual scores and predicted scores based on the test split.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split
    - sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression
    - numpy

    Example:
    >>> task_func({'Hours': [10, 20, 40], 'Scores': [90, 80, 70]})
    25.0
