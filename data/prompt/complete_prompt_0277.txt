def task_func(n):
    """
    Generate n random dots within a unit square (0 to 1 on both axes) in a 2D space 
    and find the pair that comes closest to each other.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of points to generate. If n is less than 2, the function returns None.

    Returns:
    tuple or None: A tuple of the form ((x1, y1), (x2, y2)), which are the coordinates of the closest pair,
                   or None if n is less than 2.
    
    Note:
    - This function will return None if the input n less than 2.
    
    Requirements:
    - random
    - itertools.combinations
    - math

    Example:
    >>> random.seed(0)
    >>> print(task_func(2))
    ((0.8444218515250481, 0.7579544029403025), (0.420571580830845, 0.25891675029296335))
