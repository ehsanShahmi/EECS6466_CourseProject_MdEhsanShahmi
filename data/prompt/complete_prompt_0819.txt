def task_func(iterations=5, min_delay=1.0, max_delay=2.0, seed=None):
    """
    Simulates a delay and then returns a message indicating the elapsed time. This is repeated for a specified number of iterations.

    For each iteration the delay is randomly sampled from a uniform distribution specified by min_delay and max_delay.
    After each iteration the message: '{delay} seconds have passed', where {delay} is replaces with the actual delay
    of the iteration with 2 positions after the decimal point, is saved to an array.

    The function returns a list of all messages, as well as the total delay.

    Parameters:
    - iterations (int): The number of times the delay and message should be simulated. Default is 5.
    - min_delay (float): The duration (in seconds) of the delay between messages. Default is 1.0.
    - max_delay (float): The max delay of each iteration in seconds. Default is 2.0
    - seed (float): The seed used for random sampling the delays for each iteration. Defalut is None.

    Returns:
    - list of str: A list of messages indicating the elapsed time for each iteration.
    - float: The total amount of delay

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If iterations is not a positive integer or if min_delay/max_delay is not a positive floating point value.

    Requirements:
    - time
    - random
    
    Example:
    >>> messages, delay = task_func(2, 0.4, seed=1)
    >>> print(messages)
    ['0.61 seconds have passed', '1.76 seconds have passed']
    >>> print(delay)
    2.3708767696794144

    >>> messages, delay = task_func(2, 2.0, 4.2, seed=12)
    >>> print(messages)
    ['3.04 seconds have passed', '3.45 seconds have passed']
    >>> print(delay)
