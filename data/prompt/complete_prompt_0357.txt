    """
    Draws a plot visualizing a complex distribution created from two Gaussian distributions.
    The real part of the complex distribution is a Gaussian centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 1,
    and the imaginary part is a Gaussian centered at 2 with a standard deviation of 2.

    Parameters:
        x (numpy.ndarray): The range of x values over which to plot the distribution.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The complex distribution created from the two Gaussian distributions.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `x` is not a numpy.ndarray.
    
    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - scipy.stats.norm
    - matplotlib.pyplot

    Examples:
    >>> X = np.linspace(-10, 10, 1000)
    >>> result = task_func(X)
    >>> result[0]
