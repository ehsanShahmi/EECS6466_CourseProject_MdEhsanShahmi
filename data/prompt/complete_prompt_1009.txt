def task_func(xml_content, output_csv_path):
    """
    Parses XML content from a string and converts it into a CSV format.

    Parameters:
    - xml_content (str): A string containing the XML content to be parsed. It should
                       be well-formed XML.
    - output_csv_path (str): The file path where the resulting CSV file will be saved.
                           This path must be valid and accessible for writing.

    Returns:
    - None: The function does not return any value. Instead, it writes the output to
          a CSV file at the specified path.

    Raises:
    - ET.ParseError: This exception is raised if the input XML content is malformed or
                   cannot be successfully parsed. The exception message includes
                   details about the parsing error.
    - IOError: Raised if there is an issue with writing to the specified CSV file path.
             This can happen due to reasons like invalid file path, full disk space,
             lack of write permissions, etc. The exception message provides details
             about the IO error.


    Requirements:
    - xml
    - csv

    Example:
    >>> task_func('<root><element>data</element></root>', 'path/to/output.csv')
    >>> with open('path/to/output.csv', 'r') as f:
    ...     print(f.read())
    element,data

    Note:
    - Ensure that the XML content passed to the function is well-formed.
    - The output CSV path should be a valid file path where the user has write
      permissions, to prevent IOError.
