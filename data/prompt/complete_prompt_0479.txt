def task_func(data_list, seed=0):
    """
    Replace a random substring (a sequence of characters between two commas or at the beginning/end of the string)
    in a list of strings with a random string (comprising ascii lowercase characters) with the same length as
    the substituted characters.

    Parameters:
    data_list (list): Input list of strings.
                      Within each string, each substring's leading and trailing whitespaces are removed.
                      If empty, it will return a DataFrame with the Original String and Modified String
                      columns that is otherwise empty.
    seed (int, optional): The seed for random operations to ensure reproducibility. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with two columns - 'Original String' and 'Modified String'.
               'Original String' contains the original strings from the input list, and 'Modified String'
               contains the modified strings where a random substring has been replaced.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - random
    - string

    Example:
    >>> task_func(['lamp, bag, mirror', 'table, chair, bag, lamp'])
               Original String          Modified String
    0        lamp, bag, mirror        lamp, tkg, mirror
    1  table, chair, bag, lamp  table, chair, bag, kuhm
