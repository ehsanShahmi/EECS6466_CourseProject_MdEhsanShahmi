def task_func(file_path: str, regex_pattern=r'\(.+?\)|\w') -> dict:
    """
    Extracts matches from a JSON file based on a predefined regular pattern.
    The default regular expression pattern is designed to extract any content between parentheses
    as a single match and any individual character outside the parentheses as a separate match.
    
    Parameters:
    - file_path (str): The path to the JSON file. The JSON file should contain key-value pairs
                       where the values are strings to be matched against the regex pattern.
                       
    Returns:
    - dict: A dictionary with the JSON file name as the key and a list of matches as values.
            The format is: {filename: [match1, match2, ...]}.
            
    Requirements:
    - The function makes use of the following libraries/modules: re, json, os.
    
    Example:
    >>> import tempfile
    >>> temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    >>> file_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, 'sample_data.json')
    >>> with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
    ...     json.dump({'content': 'This is a (sample) text with some (matches) and characters.'}, file)
    >>> matches = task_func(file_path)
    >>> len(matches['sample_data.json'])
