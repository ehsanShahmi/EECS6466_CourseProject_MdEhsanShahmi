def task_func(dir, api_key, recipient_email):
    """
    Get a list of files in a directory and send that list by e-mail to a specific recipient using a provided SendGrid API key.

    Parameters:
    - dir (str): The directory to list.
    - api_key (str): The SendGrid API key for authentication.
    - recipient_email (str): The email address of the recipient.

    Returns:
    - bool: True if the email was sent successfully. Specifically, a successful send is indicated by an HTTP status code in the 2xx range, which denotes success. False is returned if the directory does not exist.

    Raises:
    - FileNotFoundError: If the specified directory does not exist.
    - HTTPError: If an HTTP error occurs during the sending process.
    - Exception: For any other exceptions that may occur during the execution.

    Requirements:
    - os
    - sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient
    - sendgrid.helpers.mail.Mail
    - python_http_client.exceptions.HTTPError

    Example:
    >>> isinstance(task_func('./test_directory', 'YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY', 'YOUR_EMAIL'), bool)
    True
    >>> task_func('/nonexistent_directory', 'YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY', 'YOUR_EMAIL')  # This will return False, as the directory does not exist.
    False
