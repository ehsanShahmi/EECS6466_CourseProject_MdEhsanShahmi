def task_func(filepath, destination_dir):
    """
    Loads a DLL file specified by the given filepath and moves all DLL files in the same directory
    to another specified directory. This function demonstrates file operations including DLL loading,
    file path manipulation, and file moving using ctypes, os, shutil, and glob modules.

    Parameters:
    filepath (str): The path of the DLL file to be loaded.
    destination_dir (str): The path of the destination directory where DLL files will be moved.

    Returns:
    str: The name of the loaded DLL file.

    Requirements:
    - ctypes
    - os
    - shutil
    - glob

    Examples:
    >>> destination = 'destination_dir'
    >>> task_func('libc.so.6', destination) # Doctest will vary based on system and file availability.
    'libc.so.6'
    >>> isinstance(task_func('libc.so.6', destination), str)
    True
