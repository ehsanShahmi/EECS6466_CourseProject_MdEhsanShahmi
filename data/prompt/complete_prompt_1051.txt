def task_func(data_dict):
    """
    Analyze the uniformity of a distribution represented by a dictionary of categories and their counts,
    and create a description to introduce this distribution.

    Parameters:
    - data_dict (dict): A dictionary with categories as keys and counts as values.

    Returns:
    - tuple: A tuple containing:
        - matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes: The axes object of the histogram.
        - str: A message indicating whether the distribution is uniform ("The distribution is uniform.")
               or not ("The distribution is not uniform.").

    Note:
    - If 'data_dict' is empty, the function returns None and a message "The distribution is uniform."
       indicating that an empty distribution is considered uniform by default.
    - If 'data_dict' is not empty, it calculates the average count of the categories.
       - The distribution is considered uniform if the absolute difference between each count and the
         average count is less than or equal to 1e-5.
       - If any count's absolute difference with the average count is more than 1e-5, the distribution
         is considered not uniform.
    - The function then creates a histogram of the counts using matplotlib, with the number of bins
       being the lesser of 10 or the number of unique counts. The histogram's x-ticks are labeled with
       the category names.

    Requirements:
    - collections
    - numpy
    - matplotlib

    Example:
    >>> data = {'A': 2, 'B': 3, 'C': 4, 'D': 1, 'E': 2}
    >>> ax, message = task_func(data)
    >>> print(message)
    The distribution is not uniform.
