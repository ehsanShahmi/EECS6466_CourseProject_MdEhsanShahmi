def task_func(texts):
    """
    Creates a document-term matrix (DTM) from a list of text documents using CountVectorizer from Scikit-learn.
    Texts are preprocessed by removing non-alphanumeric characters (excluding spaces),
    converting to lowercase, and excluding English stop words defined in NLTK.

    Parameters:
    - texts (list of str): The list of text documents to convert into a DTM.

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame where rows represent documents and columns represent unique terms;
                    cell values indicate the frequency of a term in a document.

    Requirements:
    - re
    - nltk
    - pandas
    - sklearn.feature_extraction.text

    Example:
    >>> texts = ["Hello, world!", "Machine learning is great.", "Python is my favorite programming language."]
    >>> dtm = task_func(texts)
