def task_func():
    """
    Generates a DataFrame containing random grades for a predefined list of students across a set of courses.
    Each student will have one grade per course and an average grade calculated across all courses.

    Returns:
    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with columns for each student's name, their grades for each course,
               and their average grade across all courses.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - random

    Note:
    The grades are randomly generated for each course using a uniform distribution between 0 and 100.

    Example:
    >>> random.seed(0)
    >>> grades = task_func()
    >>> print(grades[['Name', 'Average Grade']].to_string(index=False))
     Name  Average Grade
      Joe         51.875
