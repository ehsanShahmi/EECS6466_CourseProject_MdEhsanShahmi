def task_func(data, cols, percentage):
    """
    Find all combinations of columns from a given DataFrame so that the absolute correlation between them is greater than a certain threshold.

    Parameters:
    - data (list): List of lists with the data, where the length of the inner list equals the number of columns
    - cols (list): List of column names
    - percentage (float): The threshold for the absolute correlation.

    Returns:
    - corr_combinations (list): A list of tuples where each tuple contains two column names.

    Requirements:

    - itertools

    Example:
    >>> result = task_func([[5.1, 5.0, 1.4], [4.9, 4.8, 1.4], [4.7, 4.6, 2.0]], ['x', 'y', 'z'], 0.9)
    >>> print(result)
    [('x', 'y')]
