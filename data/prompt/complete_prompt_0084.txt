def task_func(products, n_samples=100, sales_lower=50, sales_upper=200, profit_margin_min=0.1, profit_margin_max=0.5, random_seed=42):
    """
    Generate a sales report with randomly simulated sales and profit data for a given list of products.
    The data is aggregated by product and sorted by total profit in descending order. 
    
    Parameters:
    - products (list of str): List of product names.
    - n_samples (int): The number of data points to generate for the report. Default is 100.
    - sales_lower (int): The minimum sales value for the random generation. Default is 50.
    - sales_upper (int): The maximum sales value for the random generation. Default is 200.
    - profit_margin_min (float): The minimum profit margin as a fraction of sales. Default is 0.1.
    - profit_margin_max (float): The maximum profit margin as a fraction of sales. Default is 0.5.
    - random_seed (int): Seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility. Default is 42.

    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing aggregated sales and profit data for each product, sorted by profit.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If n_samples is not a positive integer, or if sales_lower is greater than sales_upper.
    TypeError: If products is not a list of strings, or if sales_lower, sales_upper, profit_margin_min, or profit_margin_max are not numeric.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - pandas

    Example:
    >>> products = ["iPhone", "iPad", "Macbook", "Airpods", "Apple Watch"]
    >>> report = task_func(products, n_samples=50, sales_lower=100, sales_upper=150, profit_margin_min=0.2, profit_margin_max=0.4, random_seed=42)
    >>> print(report)
