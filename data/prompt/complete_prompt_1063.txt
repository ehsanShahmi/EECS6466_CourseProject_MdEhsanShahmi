def task_func(arr):
    """
    Performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the sum of rows of a 2D numpy array and plots the explained variance ratio.

    Note:
    - The title of the plot is set to "Explained Variance Ratio of Principal Components".

    Parameters:
    - arr (numpy.ndarray): A 2D numpy array. The input data for PCA.

    Returns:
    - ax (matplotlib.axes.Axes): An Axes object from matplotlib.

    Requirements:
    - scikit-learn
    - matplotlib

    Notes:
    - The function assumes that 'arr' is a valid 2D numpy array.
    - Only the first principal component is considered in this analysis.
    - The plot illustrates the proportion of the dataset's variance that lies along the axis of this first principal component.
    
    Example:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> arr = np.array([[i+j for i in range(3)] for j in range(5)])
    >>> axes = task_func(arr)
    >>> axes.get_title()
    'Explained Variance Ratio of Principal Components'
