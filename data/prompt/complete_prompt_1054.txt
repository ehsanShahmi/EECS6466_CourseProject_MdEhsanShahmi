def task_func(file_path):
    """
    This function processes a CSV file containing numeric data representing a population. It randomly
    selects 30 individuals from this population without replacement to form a sample. The function
    calculates the mean and standard deviation of this sample. The means delta degree is 1. It also generates a histogram of the
    sample data and overlays a normal distribution curve on this histogram.

    Parameters:
    - file_path (str): A string representing the path to the CSV file. Each line in the file should contain
                     a single numeric value representing an individual in the population.

    Returns:
    - Tuple (float, float, matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes): The function returns a tuple containing
    three elements:
        - Sample mean (float): The mean of the sample.
        - Sample standard deviation (float): The standard deviation of the sample, calculated with a
           degrees of freedom (ddof) of 1.
        - Matplotlib subplot (matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes): An object representing the
           generated histogram plot with the normal distribution curve.

    Requirements:
    - csv
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - matplotlib

    Notes:
    - The function uses numpy for random sampling and statistical calculations.
    - The matplotlib library is used to plot the histogram and the normal distribution curve.
    - The function includes exception handling for file input/output errors, ensuring that any issues
      with reading the CSV file are properly communicated.
    - The function plots a histogram of the sample using matplotlib, with the number of bins
         determined automatically ('auto').

    Example:
    >>> mean, std_dev, ax = task_func('population_data.csv')
    >>> print(mean, std_dev)
    (50.5, 29.011491975882016)

    In this example, 'population_data.csv' is a CSV file where each line contains a numeric value. The
    function reads this file, samples 30 values, computes their mean and standard deviation, and plots
    a histogram with a normal distribution curve.
