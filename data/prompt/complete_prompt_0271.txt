def task_func(data_dict: dict, seed=0) -> dict:
    """
    Process the given dictionary by performing the following operations:
    1. Add a key "a" with a value of 1.
    2. Generate a random salt of length 5 using lowercase ASCII letters.
    3. For each key-value pair in the dictionary, concatenate the value with the generated salt, 
       hash the concatenated string using SHA-256, and update the value with the hashed string.
    4. Add a 'timestamp' key with the current UNIX timestamp as its value.

    Parameters:
    data_dict (dict): The dictionary to be processed. Values should be string-convertible.
    seed (int, Optional): Seed value for the random number generator. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
    dict: The processed dictionary with the hashed values and added keys.

    Requirements:
    - Uses the random, string, hashlib, and time libraries.

    Example:
    >>> task_func({'key': 'value'})["key"]
    '8691a011016e0fba3c2b0b8a26e4c9c722975f1defe42f580ab55a9c97dfccf8'
