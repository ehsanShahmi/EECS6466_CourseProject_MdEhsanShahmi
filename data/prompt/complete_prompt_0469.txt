def task_func(student_grades, possible_grades=["A", "B", "C", "D", "F"]):
    """
    Create a report on students' grades in a class, including a count of each grade out of all possible grades
    and a bar chart. Note: Grades are case-insensitive but whitespace-sensitive. Those not in possible grades
    are ignored.

    Parameters:
    student_grades (list): List of student grades. Must not be empty.
    possible_grades (list, optional): List of possible grade values. Defaults to ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F'].

    Returns:
    Tuple[DataFrame, Axes]:
        - A pandas DataFrame with 'Grade' as the named index and their 'Count' as values.
        - A bar chart plot (matplotlib's Axes object) visualizing 'Grade Distribution', with 'Grade' on the
          x-axis and 'Number of Students' on the y-axis.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib.pyplot
    - collections.Counter

    Example:
    >>> student_grades = ['A', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'D', 'F', 'B', 'A', 'C']
    >>> report_df, ax = task_func(student_grades)
    >>> type(ax)
    <class 'matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes'>
    >>> report_df
           Count
    Grade       
    A          3
    B          3
    C          2
    D          1
    F          1
