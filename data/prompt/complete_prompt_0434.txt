def task_func(s: str, seed: int = 0) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Generate a Pandas DataFrame of products with their ID, quantity, code, price, product, and description
    based on a specified string of product data.

    The input string is expected to be divided into segments by newlines. Each segment is expected to
    be further split into parts by whitespace: ID, quantity, code, price, and a product description.
    The function will remove trailing whitespaces in each field and assign a product name per unique code.
    Product name is randomly sampled from: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange', 'Pear', 'Grape'].
    The same product name will be assigned to each code for each input s, however different codes can be
    mapped to the same name.

    Parameters:
    - s    (str): Product data string split by newline, then whitespace.
                  Expected format per segment: '<ID> <Quantity> <Code> <Price> <Description>'
                  If incomplete, this function raises ValueError.
    - seed (int): Random seed for reproducibility. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
    - data_df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with columns: ['ID', 'Quantity', 'Code', 'Price', 'Product', 'Description'].
                              Quantity and Price are expected to be integers.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - re
    - random

    Examples:
    >>> s = '1 10 A10B 100 This is a description with spaces'
    >>> df = task_func(s)
    >>> df
      ID  Quantity  Code  Price Product                        Description
    0  1        10  A10B    100    Pear  This is a description with spaces

    >>> s = '1 10 A10B 100 This is a description with spaces\\n2 20 B20C 200 Another description example'
    >>> df = task_func(s)
    >>> df
      ID  Quantity  Code  Price Product                        Description
    0  1        10  A10B    100    Pear  This is a description with spaces
    1  2        20  B20C    200    Pear        Another description example
