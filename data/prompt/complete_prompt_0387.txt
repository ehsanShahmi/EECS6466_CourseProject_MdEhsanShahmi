def task_func(city_dict, max_range=1000000, seed=0):
    """
    Given a constant list of cities (CITIES) and a dictionary 'city_dict' of people's names and their favorite cities, 
    this function generates a dictionary of city populations for the cities in the list and plots the population 
    data using a bar chart. The population values are randomly generated integers between 1 and 'max_range' if 
    the city is in the list of cities, otherwise the population value is -1. The random number generator is seeded
    with the value 'seed' before generating the population values.

    Parameters:
    city_dict (dict): The dictionary with keys as people's names and values as city names. 
    max_range (int, Optional): The maximum population value for the randomly generated population. Defaults to 1000000.
    Must be greater than 1.
    seed (int, Optional): The seed for the random number generator. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary with city names as keys and randomly generated populations as values.
    matplotlib.axes.Axes: The Axes object of the plot for further manipulation or testing.

    Requirements:
    - numpy for random number generation
    - matplotlib for plotting

    Example:
    >>> city_dict = {'John': 'New York', 'Alice': 'London', 'Bob': 'Beijing', 'Charlie': 'Tokyo', 'David': 'Sydney'}
    >>> population_dict, plot_axes = task_func(city_dict)
