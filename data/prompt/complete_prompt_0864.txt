def task_func(fruit_data):
    """
    Calculate and return the total and average counts for each type of fruit.

    This function takes a list of tuples, each containing a fruit name and its count, 
    then calculates the total count and the average count for each type of fruit. 
    The results are returned as a pandas DataFrame with each row representing a different fruit.

    If fruit_data is an empty list, an empty dataFrame is returned.

    Parameters:
    fruit_data (list of tuples): Each tuple contains a string representing the fruit name and an integer for the count.

    Returns:
    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with two columns: 'Total Count' and 'Average Count'. 
               Each row's index is the fruit name.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - numpy

    Example:
    >>> fruit_list = [('apple', 5), ('banana', 3), ('apple', 6), ('banana', 4), ('cherry', 5), ('banana', 2), ('apple', 4), ('cherry', 5)]
    >>> report = task_func(fruit_list)
    >>> report.sort_index(inplace=True)
    >>> print(report)
            Total Count  Average Count
    apple            15            5.0
    banana            9            3.0
    cherry           10            5.0

    >>> fruit = [('apple', 1), ('orange', 25), ('apple', 111)]
    >>> df = task_func(fruit)
    >>> df.sort_index(inplace=True)
    >>> print(df)
            Total Count  Average Count
    apple           112           56.0
    orange           25           25.0
