def task_func(text):
    """
    Given a text as input, the function should split it into multiple sentences and build a dictionary where each key is associated with a sentence and the corresponding value is the number of words in the sentence. The function returns a pandas Series built from the dictionary.
    - The keys of the dictionary (which correspond to the Index of the pandas Series) should be named "Sentence 1", "Sentence 2" etc.
    - When counting the words in a sentence, do not consider those included in the constant STOPWORDS.
    - Do not consider empty sentences.

    Parameters:
    text (str): The text to analyze.

    Returns:
    pandas.core.series.Series: A pandas Series each sentence and its number of words that are not in STOPWORDS.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - regex

    Example:
    >>> text = "This is a sample sentence. This sentence contains sample words."
    >>> df = task_func("I am good at programming. I learned it in college.")
    >>> print(df)
    Sentence 1    5
    Sentence 2    5
