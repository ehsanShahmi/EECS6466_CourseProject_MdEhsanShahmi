def task_func(data_list):
    """
    Processes a list of category labels to create a histogram that visualizes their distribution.
    This histogram compares the distribution of a predefined set of categories (A, B, C, D, E)
    with any additional categories found in the input list.

    Parameters:
    - data_list (list): A list containing category labels (strings).

    Returns:
    - Axes object (matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes): The histogram displaying the distribution of categories.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib

    Notes:
    - The function evaluates the distribution of predefined categories ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E') and checks for uniformity.
      If the distribution is not uniform, a warning message of "The distribution of predefined categories is not uniform." is printed.
    - Categories in the data_list that are not among the predefined categories are identified and included in the histogram.
    - The ax.bar call in the function creates a bar plot on the axes object. It uses the following parameters:
        * all_categories: The categories to be displayed on the x-axis, including both predefined and extra categories.
        * category_counts.reindex(all_categories, fill_value=0): The counts of each category, where categories not found
          in the data_list are assigned a count of 0.
        * width=0.8: Sets the width of the bars in the bar plot.
        * align="center": Aligns the bars with the center of the x-ticks.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If the input data_list is empty, the function raises a ValueError with the message "The data list is empty."
      In this case, no histogram is generated and the function terminates.


    Example:
    >>> data = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']
    >>> ax = task_func(data)
    >>> ax.get_xticks()
    array([0., 1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6.])
