def task_func(epoch_milliseconds, seed=0):
    """
    Generate user activity logs from a given epoch time to the current time.

    This function iterates from the starting epoch time to the current system
    time, incrementally increasing the time by a random number of seconds (an
    integer in [1, 10]) between each log entry. Each log entry records a user
    performing an activity at a specific time.

    Parameters:
    - epoch_milliseconds (int): Starting epoch time in milliseconds. Must be in
                                the past compared to current system time.
    - seed (int): random seed for reproducibility. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing logs of user activities, with columns:
        - 'User':   User names, randomly chosen from a predefined list of users,
                    ['user1', 'user2', 'user3', 'user4', 'user5'].
        - 'Activity': Activities performed by the users, randomly chosen from a
                      predefined list of activities, ['login', 'logout', 'browse',
                      'search', 'purchase'].
        - 'Time': The timestamp of when the activity occurred, incrementally
                  increasing from the starting epoch time to the current time.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If the start time is after the current system time.
    
    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp
    - datetime.timedelta
    - random

    Example:
    >>> log = task_func(1615168051807)
    >>> type(log)
    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    >>> log.iloc[0]
    User                             user4
    Activity                        search
