def task_func(myString):
    """
    Extracts all URLs from a string and retrieves the domain and the expiration date of the SSL certificate 
    for each HTTPS URL. Only HTTPS URLs are processed; HTTP URLs are ignored. The function handles SSL errors 
    by ignoring any HTTPS URLs where the SSL certificate cannot be retrieved due to such errors, and these domains 
    are not included in the returned dictionary.

    Parameters:
    myString (str): The string from which to extract URLs.
    
    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary with domains as keys and SSL certificate expiry dates in UTC format as values. 
          The dictionary includes only those HTTPS URLs for which the SSL certificate was successfully retrieved.
          Domains with SSL errors are excluded.

    Requirements:
    - re
    - urllib.parse
    - ssl
    - socket
    
    Example:
    >>> task_func("Check these links: https://www.google.com, https://www.python.org")
    {'www.google.com': '2023-06-15 12:00:00', 'www.python.org': '2023-07-20 12:00:00'}
