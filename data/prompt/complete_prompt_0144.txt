def task_func(ip_range, timeout):
    """
    Scans a specified IP address range and sends an HTTP GET request to each IP to verify if it is an active web server.
    The function requires an IP range in CIDR format (e.g., '192.168.0.0/16') and a timeout value in seconds.
    It returns a list of IPs where the request returned a status code of 200. If the request is not success, then ignore and continue
    to the next IP address.

    Parameters:
        ip_range (str): The IP range to scan in CIDR notation.
        timeout (int): The timeout for each HTTP GET request in seconds.

    Requirements:
        - ipaddress
        - requests

    Returns:
        list: A list of IP addresses that responded with a status code of 200.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If an invalid IP range is provided.

    Examples:
    >>> type(task_func('192.168.0.0/16', 5)) is list
    True
    >>> isinstance(task_func('192.168.0.0/16', 5), list)
    True
