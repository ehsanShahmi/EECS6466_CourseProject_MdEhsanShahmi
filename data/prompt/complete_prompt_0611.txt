def task_func(df, tuples, n_plots):
    """
    Removes rows from a DataFrame based on values of multiple columns, 
    and then create n random line plots of two columns against each other.

    Parameters:
    - df (pd.DataFrame): The input pandas DataFrame.
    - tuples (list of tuple): A list of tuples, each tuple represents values in a row to be removed.
    - n_plots (int): The number of line plots to generate.

    Returns:
    - (pd.DataFrame, list): A tuple containing the modified DataFrame and a list of plot details.
      Each entry in the plot details list is a tuple containing the two columns plotted against each other.

    Requirements:
    - matplotlib.pyplot
    - random

    Example:
    >>> import numpy as np, pandas as pd
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0,100,size=(100, 5)), columns=list('ABCDE'))
    >>> tuples = [(10, 20, 30, 40, 50), (60, 70, 80, 90, 100)]
    >>> modified_df, plot_details = task_func(df, tuples, 3)
