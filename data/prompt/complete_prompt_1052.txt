def task_func(file_path, save_path=None):
    """
    This function processes a text dataset from a CSV file, performs text vectorization while excluding specific
    stopwords, and creates a histogram of the ten most common words. The function is robust to different input
    scenarios, such as empty data or data containing only stopwords.

    Parameters:
    - file_path (str): Path to the CSV file containing the text data. The CSV should have a single text column named "Text".
    - save_path (str, optional): Path where the histogram plot will be saved. If not provided, the plot is displayed.

    Returns:
    - matplotlib Axes object: If save_path is not provided and valid words are found in the input, the function
      displays the histogram plot and returns the matplotlib Axes object.
    - None: In two scenarios:
      1. If save_path is provided, saves the plot to the specified location and returns None.
      2. If the input file is empty or contains only stop words, prints a message and returns None.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - scikit-learn
    - matplotlib

    Examples:
    >>> ax = task_func('text_data.csv')
    # ax is the matplotlib Axes object for the plot
    >>> result = task_func('text_data.csv', 'output_plot.png')
    # result is None, and the plot is saved to 'output_plot.png'
