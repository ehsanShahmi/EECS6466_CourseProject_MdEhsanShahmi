def task_func(length=10000, seed=0):
    """
    Generates a random walk of a specified length. A random walk is a path that consists of a series of random steps
    on some mathematical space. In this case, the steps are either +1 or -1, chosen with equal probability.

    Parameters:
    - length (int): The number of steps in the random walk. Must be a non-negative integer. Default is 10000.
    - seed (int, optional): An optional seed value to initialize the random number generator. Use this for reproducible results.
    
    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - random
    
    Returns:
    - np.array: A numpy array representing the positions of the walk at each step. Starts at 0.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If `length` is negative.
    
    Example:
    >>> random.seed(0)     # For reproducibility in doctest
    >>> walk = task_func(5)
    >>> walk.tolist()
    [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1]
