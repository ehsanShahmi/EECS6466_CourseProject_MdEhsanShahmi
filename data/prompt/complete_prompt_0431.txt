def task_func(image_file: str) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Creates a histogram of the pixel values of a grayscale image.

    Parameters:
    - image_file (str): The path to the image file.

    Returns:
    - np.ndarray: A 1D numpy array representing the histogram of the image, with 256 bins corresponding to 
      the pixel values in the range [0, 256). Each entry in the array represents the frequency of a pixel value 
      in the grayscale image.

    Raises:
    - FileNotFoundError: If the specified image file does not exist.
    - ValueError: If the image file is not a valid image.

    Requirements:
    - opencv: For reading the image file in grayscale.
    - os: For checking the existence of the image file.
    - numpy: For calculating and storing the histogram data.

    Example:
    >>> dummy_image_path = 'dummy_image.png'
    >>> np.random.seed(48)
    >>> dummy_image = np.random.randint(0, 256, (10, 10), dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> cv2.imwrite(dummy_image_path, dummy_image)
    True
    >>> histogram = task_func(dummy_image_path)
    >>> os.remove(dummy_image_path)
    >>> print(histogram.shape)
    (256,)

    Note:
    - The function assumes the image is in grayscale format.
    - The histogram array is 1D with a size of 256, where each index corresponds to a pixel value, and the value at each index
      represents the count of pixels in the image with that pixel value.
