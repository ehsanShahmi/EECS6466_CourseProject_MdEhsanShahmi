def task_func(db_file):
    """
    Load e-mail data from an SQLite database and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame. 
    Calculate the sum, mean, and variance of the list associated with each e-mail and then record these values.

    - The function expects the SQLite database to have a table named "EmailData" with columns 'email' and 'list'.
    - The column 'list' contains a string representation of the list. It should be converted before usage.
    - The function will return a DataFrame with additional columns 'sum', 'mean', and 'var' representing the calculated sum, mean, and variance respectively for each e-mail.

    Parameters:
    - db_file (str): The path to the SQLite database file.

    Returns:
    - tuple: A tuple containing:
      - DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with email data including the calculated sum, mean, and variance.
      - Axes: A matplotlib Axes object representing the plotted bar chart of sum, mean, and variance.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - sqlite3
    - numpy
    - matplotlib.pyplot
    - ast

    Example:
    >>> df, ax = task_func('data/task_func/db_1.db')
    >>> print(df)
