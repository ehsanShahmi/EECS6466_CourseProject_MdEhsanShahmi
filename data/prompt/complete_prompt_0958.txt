def task_func(text, seed=None):
    """
    Scramble the letters in each word of a given text, keeping the first and last letters of each word intact.

    Parameters:
    text (str): The text to be scrambled.
    seed (int, optional): A seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducible results.
                          Defaults to None (not set).

    Returns:
    str: The scrambled text.

    Requirements:
    - random
    - re

    Notes:
    - Words are determined by regex word boundaries.
    - The scrambling only affects words longer than three characters, leaving shorter words unchanged.

    Examples:
    >>> task_func('Hello, world!', 0)
    'Hello, wlrod!'
    >>> task_func("Programming is fun, isn't it?", 42)
    "Prmiangmrog is fun, isn't it?"
