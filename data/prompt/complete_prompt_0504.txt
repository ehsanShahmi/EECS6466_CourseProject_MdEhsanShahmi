def task_func(file_path):
    """
    Generates a signed hash of a file's contents using RSA encryption. The file's contents are hashed using SHA-256,
    and then the hash is signed with a private RSA key stored in 'private.pem'. The signed hash is encoded in base64.

    Parameters:
    file_path (str): The path to the file whose contents are to be signed.

    Returns:
    str: The base64 encoded signed hash of the file.

    Requirements:
    - hashlib
    - rsa
    - base64

    Examples:
    Assuming 'example.txt' contains some text and a valid 'private.pem' is present,
    >>> len(task_func('example.txt')) > 0
    True

    Assuming 'empty.txt' is an empty file and a valid 'private.pem' is present,
    >>> len(task_func('empty.txt')) > 0
    True
