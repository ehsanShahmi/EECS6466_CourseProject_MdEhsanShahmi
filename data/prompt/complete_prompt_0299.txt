def task_func(elements, subset_size, top_n=2):
    """
    Generate all subsets of a given size from a tuple and calculate the product of the sums of the subsets. Additionally, 
    return the top_n sums of the subsets. If the subset size is larger than the tuple length, return 1. If the subset size is 0,
    return 1.

    Parameters:
    - elements (tuple): A tuple of elements to create subsets from.
    - subset_size (int): The size of the subsets to be generated.
    - top_n (int, Optional): The number of top subsets to return. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
    int: The product of the sums of the subsets.
    list: The top_n sums of the subsets as a pandas Series.


    Requirements:
    - itertools
    - math
    
    Example:
    >>> prod, sums = task_func((1, 2, 3), 2)
    >>> prod
    60
    >>> list(sums)
    [5, 4]
