def task_func(data):
    """
    Processes a given dataset to compute the average of each row, plots the distribution of these averages,
    and evaluates their normality. The function returns these averages as an additional column in a DataFrame,
    the plot of the distribution, and the p-value from the normality test if applicable.

    Parameters:
    data (numpy.array): A 2D numpy array with eight columns representing different data types or categories, with a
    shape of (n_samples, 8).

    Returns:
    tuple: Contains three elements:
        - DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with the original data and an added 'Average' column.
        - Axes object: The Axes object from the seaborn distribution plot of the averages.
        - float or None: The p-value from the normality test on the averages, or None
        if the test could not be conducted.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - seaborn
    - scipy

    Raises:
    ValueError: If the input data does not have exactly eight columns.

    Note:
    The function uses seaborn's distplot for visualization and scipy's normaltest for statistical analysis.
    It requires at least 20 data points to perform the normality test.

    Example:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> data = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 7, 1], [6, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 1]])
    >>> df, ax, p_value = task_func(data)
    >>> print(df)
       A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  Average
    0  1  2  3  4  4  3  7  1    3.125
    1  6  2  3  4  3  4  4  1    3.375
    >>> print(p_value)
    None
