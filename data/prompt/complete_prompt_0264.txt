def task_func(dictionary, key, value, n=100, bins=30, seed=0):
    """
    Updates the provided dictionary with a specified key-value pair and generates a random dataset of size 'n' 
    following a normal distribution. The mean and standard deviation of the distribution are set to the value 
    associated with the given key. Additionally, it returns a histogram of the generated dataset.
    
    Parameters:
    - dictionary (dict): The dictionary to be updated.
    - key (str): The key to be added to the dictionary.
    - value (str): The value to be associated with the provided key.
    - n (int, optional): The size of the random dataset to be generated. Default is 100.
    - bins (int, optional): The number of bins for the histogram. Default is 30.
    - seed (int, optional): The seed for the random number generator. Default is 0.
    
    Returns:
    - tuple: Updated dictionary and the generated dataset as a pandas Series along with the histogram plot.
    
    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - pandas

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If the provided value is not a number.
    
    Example:
    >>> d, data, ax = task_func({'key1': 10, 'key2': 20}, 'newkey', '25', n=500)
    >>> d
    {'key1': 10, 'key2': 20, 'newkey': '25'}
    >>> len(data)
    500
