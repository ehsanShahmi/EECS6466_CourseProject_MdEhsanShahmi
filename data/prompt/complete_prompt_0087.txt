def task_func(products, ratings, weights, random_seed=42):
    """
    Generates a DataFrame containing ratings for a given list of products. Ratings are generated randomly based on the provided weights. 
    The DataFrame is sorted by ratings in descending order.

    Parameters:
    products (list): List of product names.
    ratings (list): List of possible ratings.
    weights (list): List of weights corresponding to each rating for weighted random selection.
    random_seed (int, optional): Seed for random number generation for reproducibility. Defaults to 42.

    Returns:
    pandas.DataFrame: A DataFrame with two columns: 'Product' and 'Rating', sorted by 'Rating' in descending order.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - random

    Example:
    >>> products = ["iPhone", "iPad", "Macbook", "Airpods", "Apple Watch"]
    >>> ratings = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> weights = [0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.35]
    >>> df = task_func(products, ratings, weights, 42)
    >>> print(df.head()) # Expected output is a DataFrame sorted by 'Rating', which may vary due to randomness.
