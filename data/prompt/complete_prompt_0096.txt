    """
    Reads a CSV file and counts the most common words in the file.

    This function opens the specified CSV file using the provided delimiter, reads its contents,
    and counts the frequency of each word. It returns a list of tuples, each containing a word 
    and its frequency, sorted by frequency in descending order.

    Note: The function assumes that each cell in the CSV contains a single word.

    Parameters:
        csv_file (str): The path to the CSV file to be read.
        csv_delimiter (str): The delimiter used in the CSV file.

    Requirements:
    - csv
    - collections.Counter
    - operator

    Returns:
        list of tuple: A list of tuples where each tuple contains a word and its count,
                       sorted by count in descending order.

    Examples:
    >>> with open(temp_data.csv, "w") as f:
    >>>     f.write("word1,word2,word3")
    >>> type(task_func('temp_data.csv', ',')) == list
    True
    >>> all(isinstance(pair, tuple) and len(pair) == 2 for pair in task_func('temp_data.csv', ','))
    True
