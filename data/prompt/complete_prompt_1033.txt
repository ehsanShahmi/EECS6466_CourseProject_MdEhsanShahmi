def task_func():
    """
    Generate all possible 3-letter combinations of the alphabet, save them in a pandas DataFrame,
    and draw a histogram of the frequency of the first letters in these combinations.

    This function uses itertools.product to create all possible combinations of three letters.
    It then creates a DataFrame from these combinations and plots a histogram to show the frequency
    of each letter appearing as the first letter in these combinations.

    Parameters:
    - None

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with all 3-letter combinations.
        - Axes: A matplotlib Axes object representing the histogram plot.

    Requirements:
    - itertools
    - string
    - pandas

    Example:
    >>> df, ax = task_func()
    >>> print(df.head())
       a  b  c
    0  a  a  a
    1  a  a  b
    2  a  a  c
    3  a  a  d
    4  a  a  e
