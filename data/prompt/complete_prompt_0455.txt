def task_func(mean, std_dev, n):
    """
    Generates a set of samples from a normal distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation.
    It also visualizes the generated samples by plotting their histogram and the probability density function.

    Parameters:
    mean (float): The mean (mu) of the normal distribution.
    std_dev (float): The standard deviation (sigma) of the distribution.
    n (int): The number of samples to generate.

    Returns:
    numpy.ndarray: An array of generated samples from the normal distribution.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - scipy.stats
    - matplotlib.pyplot

    Examples:
    Generate 1000 samples from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
    >>> len(task_func(0, 1, 1000))
    1000

    Generate 500 samples from a normal distribution with mean 5 and standard deviation 2.
    >>> len(task_func(5, 2, 500))
    500
