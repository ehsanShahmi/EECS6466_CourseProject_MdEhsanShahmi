def task_func(csv_file_path, col1_name="column1", col2_name="column2"):
    """
    Reads data from a CSV file and generates a bar plot based on grouped mean values.

    The DataFrame is grouped by the column named 'col1_name',
    and the mean for each group is calculated for the column 'col2_name'.
    A bar plot is created using matplotlib. Each bar in the plot represents a group,
    and its height corresponds to the mean value of 'col2_name' for that group.
    The plot is then configured with a title and axis labels:
       - The title is set as "Mean of [col2_name] Grouped by [col1_name]".
       This format dynamically inserts the names of the columns being analyzed into the title.
       - The xlabel (label for the x-axis) is set to the name of the column used for grouping (col1_name).
       - The ylabel (label for the y-axis) is set as "Mean of [col2_name]",
       indicating that the y-axis represents the mean values of the specified column.

    Parameters:
    - csv_file_path (str): The file path to the CSV file.
    This parameter is mandatory and specifies the location of the CSV file to be read.
    - col1_name (str, optional): The name of the column used for grouping the data.
    If not provided, defaults to 'column1'. This column should exist in the CSV file.
    - col2_name (str, optional): The name of the column for which the mean is calculated for each group.
    If not provided, defaults to 'column2'. This column should exist in the CSV file and contain numerical data.

    Returns:
    - matplotlib.axes.Axes: The Axes object of the generated bar plot.
    This object can be used to further customize the plot, like adding labels or changing styles.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib

    Example:
    >>> ax = task_func("data.csv", "group_column", "value_column")
    >>> ax.get_title()
    'Mean of value_column Grouped by group_column'

    Note:
    - Ensure that the CSV file exists at the specified path and has the required columns.
    - The function does not handle missing data. Ensure that the CSV file has clean and complete data for accurate results.
    - The bar plot is customizable using matplotlib's functionality after the function returns the Axes object.
