def task_func(data_dict, source_directory, backup_directory):
    """
    Modifies a dictionary, sorts it by the frequency of its values, and backs up files from a source directory.

    This function performs three main tasks:
    1. Updates the input dictionary by adding a key 'a' with the value 1.
    2. Sorts the dictionary by the frequency of its values in descending order.
    3. Backs up all files from the specified source directory to a backup directory.

    Parameters:
        data_dict (dict): The dictionary to be modified and sorted.
        source_directory (str): The path to the source directory containing files to be backed up.
        backup_directory (str): The path to the backup directory where files will be copied.

    Returns:
        tuple:
            - dict: The modified dictionary with the added key and value.
            - list: A list of tuples representing the sorted items of the dictionary by their frequency.
            - bool: A boolean indicating whether the backup was successful (True) or not (False).

    Requirements:
     - collections
     - operator
     - os
     - shutil

    Examples:
    >>> data_dict = {'b': 'val1', 'c': 'val2'}
    >>> updated_dict, value_frequencies, backup_status = task_func(data_dict, 'folder1', 'backup_folder')
    >>> print(updated_dict)
    {'a': 1, 'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
    >>> print(value_frequencies)
    [('val1', 1), ('val2', 1), (1, 1)]
    >>> print(backup_status)
    True

    >>> data_dict = {'avc': '1', 'hello': 'world', 'test': 'world', 'cat': 'meow'}
    >>> updated_dict, value_frequencies, backup_status = task_func(data_dict, 'to_backup', 'backup')
    >>> print(updated_dict)
    {'a': 1, 'avc': '1', 'hello': 'world', 'test': 'world', 'cat': 'meow'}
    >>> print(value_frequencies)
    [('avc', 1), ('world', 2), ('meow', 1), (1, 2)]
    >>> print(backup_status)
    True
