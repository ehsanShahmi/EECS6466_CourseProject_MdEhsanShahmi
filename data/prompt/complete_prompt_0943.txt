    """
    Generate a sales time-series and decompose it into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
    
    Parameters:
    - start_date (str): The start date of the time-series in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Default is '2016-01-01'.

    - numpy
    - pandas
    - statsmodels
    
    Examples:
    >>> result = task_func('2016-01-01', 24, 'M')
    >>> all(key in result for key in ['trend', 'seasonal', 'residual'])
    True

    >>> result = task_func('2020-01-01', 24, 'M', 'multiplicative')
    >>> len(result['seasonal'])
