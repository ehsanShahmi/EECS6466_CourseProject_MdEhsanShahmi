    Divide a CSV file into several smaller files and shuffle the lines in each file.
    
    This function takes a CSV file path as input, divides it into smaller files using 
    the shell 'split' command, and shuffles the rows in each of the resulting files.
    The output files are named with a 'split_' prefix.

    Parameters:
    - file (str): The path to the CSV file.

    Returns:
    - list: The paths to the split files. Returns an empty list if the file does not exist, is not a CSV file, or if an error occurs during processing.
    
    Requirements:
    - subprocess
    - csv
    - glob
    - random
    - os

    Example:
    >>> task_func('/path/to/file.csv')
    ['/path/to/split_00', '/path/to/split_01', ...]
