def task_func(letter_list, element, log_path):
    """
    Count the frequency of a particular letter in a given list of letters with logging.

    Logs are written to a file named 'task_func.log' with encoding 'utf-8' and logging level DEBUG.
    The log file is created by the function or overwritten if already exists.
    For each function call the following is logged with the respective logging level:
        - info: f"Function called with list: {letter_list} and element: {element}"
        - error: if the element is not in the letter list
        - info: f"Frequency of '{element}' is {element_frequency}"
    
    After the last info has been logged, the logging is shutdown, such that all
    files are released.

    Parameters:
    letter_list (list of str): The list of letters.
    element (str): The specific letter for which the frequency needs to be counted.
    log_path (str): the path to the folder in which to save the log file

    Returns:
    int: The frequency of the letter.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If element is not in letter_list.

    Requirements:
    - collections
    - logging

    Example:
    >>> task_func(['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'a'], 'a', log_path='./')
    3
    >>> with open('task_func.log') as log:
    ...     print(log.read())
    INFO:Function called with list: ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'a'] and element: a
    INFO:Frequency of 'a' is 3
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> task_func(['x', 'y', 'z'], 'y', log_path='./')
    1
    >>> with open('task_func.log') as log:
    ...     print(log.read())
    INFO:Function called with list: ['x', 'y', 'z'] and element: y
    INFO:Frequency of 'y' is 1
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> try:
    ...     task_func(['x', 'y', 'z'], 'a', log_path='./')
    ... except:
    ...     with open('task_func.log') as log:
    ...        print(log.read())
    INFO:Function called with list: ['x', 'y', 'z'] and element: a
    ERROR:The element is not in the letter list.
    <BLANKLINE>
