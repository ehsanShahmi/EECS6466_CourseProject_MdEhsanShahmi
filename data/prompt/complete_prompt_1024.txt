def task_func(data_dict):
    """
    Processes a dictionary of numerical data to create a pandas DataFrame, removes None values, and generates a histogram 
    of the data values using seaborn. The histogram's bins are dynamically calculated based on the range of the data. Specifically,
    the number of bins is set to the minimum of 11 and half the number of data points, with a minimum of 2 bins.
    If the DataFrame is empty or the data lacks variability (all values are the same after removing None values), 
    the function does not generate a plot.

    Parameters:
    - data_dict (dict): A dictionary with keys as column names and values as lists of numerical data. 
                      The data can include None values, which will be removed.

    Returns:
    - DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame created from the input dictionary, excluding None values.
    - Axes or None: A seaborn histogram plot object if the DataFrame contains variable data; 
                               None if the DataFrame is empty or if all values are identical.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - seaborn

    Note:
    - Calculates the minimum and maximum values in the DataFrame.
    - Dynamically sets the number of bins for the histogram based on the number of data points, with a minimum of 2 
         and a maximum of 11 bins.
    - Create evenly spaced bin edges between the minimum and maximum values.
    - KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) is turned off. 
    - Sets the plot title to the predefined constant `PLOT_TITLE`.


    Example:
    >>> data = {'a': [1, 2, 3, None], 'b': [5, 6, None, 8]}
    >>> df, plot = task_func(data)
    >>> df
         a    b
    0  1.0  5.0
    1  2.0  6.0
    >>> plot.get_title() if plot is not None else 'No plot generated'
    'Value Distribution'
