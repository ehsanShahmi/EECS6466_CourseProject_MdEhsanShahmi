def task_func():
    """
    Creates and displays a diagram of a parabola represented by the equation y = x^2.
    The function plots the parabola using matplotlib, sets the title as 'y = x^2', labels the axes as 'x' and 'y',
    and enables the grid. It uses a fixed range for x values from -10 to 10 with 400 points.
    This function is used for demonstrating basic plotting capabilities and visualizing
    quadratic functions. The function does not take any parameters and does not return any value.

    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - matplotlib.pyplot

    Parameters:
    None
    
    Returns:
    None
    
    Examples:
    >>> task_func() # This will display the plot of the parabola y = x^2
    >>> type(task_func())
    <class 'NoneType'>
