    """
    Counts matches from a CSV file based on a given regex pattern. 
    By default, it captures content between parentheses as a single match and 
    any word or sequence of non-alphanumeric characters outside as matches in a string.
    
    Parameters:
    - file_path (str): The path to the CSV file.
    - regex_pattern (str, optional): The regex pattern to find matches. Defaults to capturing content between parentheses or individual words or sequences of non-alphanumeric characters.
    
    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary with counts of matches.

    Requirements:
    - re
    - csv
    - collections.Counter
    
    Example:
    >>> import tempfile
    >>> temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    >>> file_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, 'data.csv')
    >>> with open(file_path, 'w', newline='') as file:
    ...     writer = csv.writer(file)
    ...     _ = writer.writerow(['a'])
    ...     _ = writer.writerow(['b'])
    ...     _ = writer.writerow(['(abc)'])
    >>> counts = task_func(file_path)
    >>> print(counts)
    {'a': 1, ' ': 1, 'b': 1, ' (': 1, 'abc': 1, ')': 1}
