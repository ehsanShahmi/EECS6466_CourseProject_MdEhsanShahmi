def task_func(repo_url: str) -> dict:
    """
    Fetches and returns information about a GitHub repository using its API URL. The function makes an HTTP GET
    request to the provided repository URL. It incorporates error handling for various scenarios including API
    rate limits, other HTTP errors, and general request issues. The function also checks for a large number of
    open issues in the repository and prints a warning if they exceed a certain threshold.

    Parameters:
    - repo_url (str): The URL of the GitHub repository API.

    Returns:
    - dict: A dictionary containing information about the GitHub repository.

    Raises:
    - requests.exceptions.HTTPError: If an HTTP error occurs, particularly when the GitHub API rate limit is
            exceeded.
    - requests.exceptions.RequestException: For other general issues encountered during the API request, such
            as network problems, invalid responses, or timeouts.

    Requirements:
    - requests
    - logging

    Example:
    >>> task_func('https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests')
    { ... }  # dictionary containing repo information
    >>> task_func('https://api.github.com/repos/some/repo')
    { ... }  # dictionary containing repo information with a possible runtime warning about open issues
