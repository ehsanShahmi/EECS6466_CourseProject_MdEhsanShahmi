def task_func(epoch_milliseconds, seed=None):
    """
    Generate and draw a sales trend for different categories from a particular epoch milliseconds
    to the current UTC time.

    The function selects category from ['Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home', 'Books', 'Sports'].
    Each day's sales are randomly determined between 10 and 50 units for each category.
    The plot's x-axis represents 'Days since (the start date)', and the y-axis represents 'Sales' units.

    Parameters:
    - epoch_milliseconds (int): Start time. Must be positive and before current time.
    - seed (int, optional): Seed for random number generation. Default is None (no seed).

    Returns:
    - sales_data (dict): Sales data for different categories over days.
    - ax (plt.Axes): The plot depicting the sales trend.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If the start time is negative or after the current time.
    
    Requirements:
    - random
    - datetime.datetime
    - matplotlib

    Example:
    >>> random.seed(42)
    >>> sales_data, ax = task_func(1236472051807, seed=42)
    >>> type(sales_data)
    <class 'dict'>
    >>> list(sales_data['Electronics'])[:3]
    [50, 24, 47]
    >>> type(ax)
    <class 'matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes'>
