def task_func(days, random_seed=0):
    """
    Generates a spending report DataFrame for the given number of days.

    This function takes a number of days as input and populates a pandas DataFrame
    with fake expenditure data indexed by date. Each day on or after '2023-01-01'
    has its own row. The DataFrame has five columns: Groceries, Entertainment, Rent,
    Utilities, and Miscellaneous, with their integer values independently randomly
    sampled from 0 to 100.

    Parameters:
    - days (int): Number of days for which the report is to be generated.
                  This is used to generate dates starting from '2023-01-01'.
                  For example, a 'days' of 2 will generate data for '2023-01-01',
                  '2023-01-02'.
                  If 0, this function will return a DataFrame with the expected
                  columns that is otherwise empty.
    - random_seed (int): Numpy random seed for reproducibility. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing spending details for specified days,
                    with shape (num_days, 5).

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - numpy

    Example:
    >>> df = task_func(5, random_seed=42)
    >>> type(df)
    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    >>> df.head(2)
                Groceries  Entertainment  Rent  Utilities  Miscellaneous

    2023-01-01         51             20    87         52              1
    2023-01-02         92             82    99          1             63
