def task_func(letters, repetitions, colors):
    """
    Create a bar chart to visualize the frequency of each letter in a flattened list 
    formed by multiple repetitions of the original list. Each repetition of the list 
    is associated with a different color in the chart.
    
    Note:
    - Generate a bar chart for the frequency of letters, where each letter's frequency
      is determined by its number of repetitions.
    - Each letter's bar in the chart is colored according to the specified color.
    - The length of the list `colors` should match the number of repetitions of `letters`.
    - The lists 'letters' and 'colors' cannot be empty.
    
    Parameters:
    - letters (list of str): A list of unique letters to be visualized.
    - repetitions (list of int): A list of the number of times each letter is repeated.
      Must be the same length as `letters`.
    - colors (list of str): A list of colors for the bars corresponding to each letter.
      Must be the same length as `letters`.
    
    Returns:
    - Returns the Matplotlib Axes object representing the created bar chart, with the x-axis labeled 'Letters', y-axis labeled 'Frequency', and title 'Frequency of Letters'.
    
    Raises:
    - ValueError: If the lengths of the input lists do not match or if any list is empty.
    
    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - matplotlib.pyplot
    
    Example:
    >>> ax = task_func(['A', 'B', 'C'], [3, 5, 2], ['red', 'green', 'blue'])
    >>> type(ax)
    <class 'matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes'>
