def task_func(feature: pd.Series, target: pd.Series) -> (np.ndarray, plt.Axes):
    """
    Train a logistic regression model on one feature and evaluate its performance using a confusion matrix plot.
    The function takes a feature and a target series, splits them into training and testing sets, trains the logistic
    regression model, predicts the target for the test set, and plots the confusion matrix.

    Parameters:
    feature (pd.Series): Series representing the single feature for the logistic regression model.
    target (pd.Series): Series representing the target variable.

    Returns:
    (np.ndarray, plt.Axes): A tuple containing the confusion matrix and the matplotlib Axes object of the confusion matrix plot.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split
    - sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression
    - sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix
    - numpy
    - matplotlib.pyplot

    Example:
    >>> feature = pd.Series(np.random.rand(1000)) # Feature data
    >>> target = pd.Series(np.random.randint(0, 2, size=1000)) # Target data (binary)
    >>> cm, ax = task_func(feature, target)
    >>> ax.get_title()
    'Confusion Matrix'
