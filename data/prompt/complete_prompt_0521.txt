def task_func(data_list):
    """
    Visualizes the scores of students over multiple tests using a line plot.

    The function takes in a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains the name of a student (key)
    and their score (value). It combines these dictionaries into a pandas DataFrame and plots a line graph
    of student scores over tests, where the x-axis represents the test number and the y-axis represents the score.
    Each student's scores are plotted as separate lines. Missing scores are handled by not plotting
    those specific data points, allowing for discontinuous lines where data is missing.

    Parameters:
    - data_list (list of dict): A list of dictionaries with student names as keys and their scores as values.

    Returns:
    - ax (matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes): The Axes object with the plotted data.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib.pyplot

    Example:
    >>> data = [{'John': 5, 'Jane': 10}, {'John': 6, 'Jane': 8}, {'John': 5, 'Jane': 9}]
    >>> ax = task_func(data)
    >>> type(ax)
    <class 'matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes'>
    >>> ax.get_xticklabels()
    [Text(-0.25, 0, '−0.25'), Text(0.0, 0, '0.00'), Text(0.25, 0, '0.25'), Text(0.5, 0, '0.50'), Text(0.75, 0, '0.75'), Text(1.0, 0, '1.00'), Text(1.25, 0, '1.25'), Text(1.5, 0, '1.50'), Text(1.75, 0, '1.75'), Text(2.0, 0, '2.00'), Text(2.25, 0, '2.25')]
