def task_func(source_path, destination_path):
    """
    Lists files in the specified source directory without descending into subdirectories and copies them to a
    destination directory.

    Parameters:
    - source_path (str):      The source directory path to analyze. Must be an existing, accessible directory.
    - destination_path (str): The destination directory path where files will be copied.
                              If it does not exist, this function will create it.

    Returns:
    Tuple[str, List[str]]: A tuple containing the name of the source directory and a list of filenames (not
                           full paths) that were copied.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If source_path does not exist or is not a directory.

    Requirements:
    - shutil
    - pathlib

    Example:
    >>> x = task_func('/Docs/src/Scripts')
    >>> type(x)
    <class 'tuple'>
    >>> x
    ('Scripts', ['file_1_in_scripts_dir.txt', 'file_2_in_scripts_dir.txt'])
