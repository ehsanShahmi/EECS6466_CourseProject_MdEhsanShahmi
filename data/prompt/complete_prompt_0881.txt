def task_func(csv_file, column_name='data', pattern='\d+[xX]', sample_size=None, seed=42):
    """ 
    Search for matches with a specified regex pattern in a given column of a CSV file and optionally return a random sample of these matches.
    
    The random sampling is implemented by generating a random list of integers which are used as indices.
    The number of generated indices is given by sample_size.
    

    Parameters:
    csv_file (str): Path to the CSV file.
    column_name (str, optional): The name of the column to search. Defaults to 'data'.
    pattern (str, optional): The regex pattern to search for. Defaults to '\d+[xX]'.
    sample_size (int, optional): Number of random samples to return from the matches. If None, all matches are returned. Defaults to None.
    seed (int, optional): Seed for the random number generator for reproducibility. Defaults to 42.
    
    Returns:
    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame containing either all the rows with matches or a random sample of them.
    
    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - random: for generating the random list of indices
    
    Example:
    >>> result = task_func('sample.csv', column_name='data', pattern='\d+[xX]', sample_size=10, seed=42)
    >>> print(result)
