def task_func(n, seed=None):
    """
    Generate a dictionary with lists of random lowercase english letters. 
    
    Each key in the dictionary  represents a unique letter from the alphabet,
    and the associated value is a list, containing randomly generated instances
    of that letter based on a seed.

    The function randomly selects 'n' letters from the alphabet (a-z) and places each 
    occurrence in the corresponding list within the dictionary. The randomness is based
    on the provided seed value; the same seed will produce the same distribution of letters.

    The dictionary has only those keys for which a letter was generated.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of random letters to generate.
    seed (int, optional): A seed value for the random number generator. If None, the randomness
                          is based on system time or the OS's randomness source.

    Returns:
    defaultdict: A dictionary where the keys are characters ('a' to 'z') and the values 
                 are lists of randomly generated letters. Each list may have 0 to 'n' occurrences of 
                 its associated letter, depending on the randomness and seed.

    Requirements:
    - collections.defaultdict
    - random
    - string

    Example:
    >>> task_func(5, seed=123)
    defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'b': ['b'], 'i': ['i'], 'c': ['c'], 'y': ['y'], 'n': ['n']})

    >>> task_func(30, seed=1)
    defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'e': ['e'], 's': ['s'], 'z': ['z', 'z', 'z'], 'y': ['y', 'y', 'y', 'y'], 'c': ['c'], 'i': ['i', 'i'], 'd': ['d', 'd'], 'p': ['p', 'p', 'p'], 'o': ['o', 'o'], 'u': ['u'], 'm': ['m', 'm'], 'g': ['g'], 'a': ['a', 'a'], 'n': ['n'], 't': ['t'], 'w': ['w'], 'x': ['x'], 'h': ['h']})
