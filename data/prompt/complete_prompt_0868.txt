def task_func(n_colors, colors=['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Purple'], rng_seed=None):
    """
    Generates a list representing a color pattern. The pattern consists of 'n_colors' elements 
    and alternates between a cyclic sequence of colors as defined in the parameter 'colors',
    and random colors from the same list.
    Optionally, a seed for the random number generator can be provided for repeatable randomness.

    If n_colors is smaller than or equal to zero an empty list is returned.

    Parameters:
    n_colors (int): The number of colors to include in the pattern. This number indicates the total 
                    elements in the returned list, alternating between cyclic and random colors.
    colors (list of str, optional): The list of colors to generate from. 
                Defaults to  ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Purple'].
    rng_seed (int, optional): A seed for the random number generator to ensure repeatability of the color selection. 
                              If 'None', the randomness is based on system time or other sources of entropy.

    Returns:
    list: A list representing the color pattern. Each element of the list is a string indicating 
          the color. For example, with n_colors=4 and a specific seed, the result could be consistent 
          across calls with the same seed.

    Requirements:
    - itertools
    - random

    Examples:
    >>> color_pattern = task_func(4, rng_seed=123)
    >>> print(color_pattern)
    ['Red', 'Red', 'Green', 'Blue']

    >>> colors = ['Brown', 'Green', 'Black']
    >>> color_pattern = task_func(12, colors=colors, rng_seed=42)
    >>> print(color_pattern)
    ['Brown', 'Black', 'Green', 'Brown', 'Black', 'Brown', 'Brown', 'Black', 'Green', 'Green', 'Black', 'Brown']
