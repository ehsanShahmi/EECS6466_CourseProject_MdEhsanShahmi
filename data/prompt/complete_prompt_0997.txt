    Download and extract a zip file from a specified URL to a designated directory.

    Parameters:
    - url (str): The URL of the zip file.

    Returns:
    - str: The path of the directory where the contents of the zip file are extracted.

    Requirements:
      - urllib
      - os
      - zipfile

    Behavior:
    - If the target directory TARGET_DIR does not exist, it is created.
    - The zip file is downloaded from the given URL and saved locally as TARGET_ZIP_FILE.
    - The local zip file TARGET_ZIP_FILE is deleted after extraction.

    Error Handling:
    - The function does not explicitly handle errors that may occur during the download or extraction process.
      Errors such as a failed download, invalid URL, or corrupted zip file will result in an unhandled exception.

    Examples:
    >>> task_func("http://example.com/files.zip")
    'downloaded_files'
