    The window remains open after drawing.

    Parameters:
        colors (list): A list of color names (as strings) to use for drawing the squares.

    Returns:
        None.

    Requirements:
    - random.choice
    - turtle
    - time

    Examples:
    >>> task_func(['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'purple'])  # This will open a Turtle Graphics window and draw squares
    >>> turtle.TurtleScreen._RUNNING
    True  # Check if the Turtle Graphics screen is running
